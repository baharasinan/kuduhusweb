My name is Luke Cook — I am an actor from The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Katy Keene, Dynasty, Dollface and I am not a millionaire,” Cook, 36. explained in a <a href=#>TikTok video</a> posted on Friday, July 14. “I drive a 2010 Mazda and my previous car was a 2006 Ford Taurus. 95 percent of people in SAG cannot make a living from acting, they have to have side hustles. I am one of those actors.”</p><p>He continued: “The actors who you are thinking of — who are the millionaires — are usually series regulars or A-listers in big movies. The actors who surround them though are actors like myself — guest stars, costars, etc. We are paid chips.”</p><p>As an example, Cook broke down his income <a href=#>for playing Fender in four episodes of Hulu’s Dollface</a>. “I did a show called Dollface last year and they put me on a billboard on Sunset [Boulevard]. Do you know how much they paid me to be on the billboard? Zero [dollars],” he said. “The amount they paid me to be on the show was not much better.”</p><p>Cook, who <a href=#>shares two kids with wife <strong>Kara Wilson</strong></a>, also noted that he doesn’t see most of his paycheck, adding, “I get paid per episode which is two weeks of work [and it came out to] $7,500. Then it is taxed and a manager takes 10 percent, an agent takes 10 percent and a lawyer takes 5 percent. I am one line below a series regular who is maybe making $100,000, sometimes per episode. They are very wealthy and they are worth it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Luke-Cook-Reveals-Shockingly-Low-Income-as-an-Actor-Amid-Strike-inline.png><p>The S.W.A.T. alum went on to show his support for the SAG-AFTRA union.</p><p>“Huge portion of this strike is about people like me who need to be paid more for the work that they do and let them have a portion of the profits that these big streamers are bringing it. So, this discussion isn’t about millionaires,” he continued. “As I said, 90 percent of the union can’t make enough money to live just be doing this job. … As someone who always has a side job, I think it would be great to get paid better money to be on your favorite shows. That seems fair to me. Like if you see me on TV, I shouldn’t have to have two side jobs just in order to survive.”</p><p>Earlier this month, SAG-AFTRA authorized a strike after the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) did <a href=#>not address any of their concerns regarding fair wages</a>, the use of artificial intelligence and more issues during contract negotiations.</p><p>The decision came two months after the Writers Guild of America <a href=#>announced their own strike over a labor dispute</a> with the AMPTP — the organization that represents major networks such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal, Paramount and Sony.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After sharing a breakdown of his wages, Cook <a href=#>clapped back at a comment that claimed</a> he was lying.</p><p>“I have been caught. I am a millionaire. Some genius looked up my net worth on Google. I have done some recurring guest star [roles] and I am now a millionaire,” he quipped during a second video which he posted on Sunday, July 16. “If you think I am a millionaire, get up at 5 A.M. on Monday morning and come to my fitness classes and ask yourself as I am teaching, ‘I can’t believe he is teaching fitness. $5 million dollars and he is still teaching classes for $50 each.’ That way you convinced yourself that I am a millionaire who works three jobs for no reason.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOuo5VisLC7ymapnq6Vlrm0edKhppyjmaO0rcWMpaawZZGYwbC%2BjKKlnKedmnqiucidZKyZl2Kup8DRmmSsrKKeuKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
