Even more, she gushed about her little one and explained how motherhood has given her more confidence.</p><p>“The love thing is astonishing. It’s a very primal, primal love. That’s quite extraordinary. And the ability to have no sleep and continue going. It’s not pleasant — I never thought that I could actually do it for the amount of time that I’ve done it,” Knightley, 30, said.</p><p>She went on to talk about how giving birth had changed the way she sees herself. “Also, I have to say, as a woman, you hate certain parts of your body,” she told the mag. “You go through those periods where you look in the mirror and you think, ‘Oh, if only I had different legs or arms or whatever.’ You go through pregnancy and labor and then feeding the kid and you go, ‘Wow, my body is totally amazing, and I’m never going to not like it again, because it did this, and this is f—king extraordinary.'”&nbsp;</p><p>The Imitation Game actress and Righton, 31, <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a> together back in May. Prior to giving birth, Knightley paraded her adorable baby bump around awards season with ease. (Although she did have a <a href=#>“pregnant lady!” restroom</a> moment at the Golden Globes!) Her 30th birthday, however? Not much of a party.</p><p>“I was heavily pregnant, I couldn’t drink — what is the point of having a thirtieth birthday if I couldn’t get phenomenally drunk? But my husband took over, arranged a lovely lunch at one of my favorite restaurants, 20 of us, and they were all being so sweet, like, ‘Look, you can have a great time and be sober!’ And it’s fine apart from the fact that they started drinking at about one,” Knightley recalled to the mag.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Then they came back to our house — they’d covered it in balloons that said my name and happy birthday and all that — and they got completely obliterated,” she continued. “They were there until two or three in the morning, absolutely drunk, and I was there eight months pregnant, completely sober. So it was lovely, but it wasn’t what I’d imagined a thirtieth birthday was going to be.”</p><p>Knightley is probably more focused on changing diapers than wine drinking anyway these days – in-between any upcoming therapy sessions, that is. “Oh, f—k, yeah!” she said when asked if she’s tried therapy. “I’ve totally done therapy. I highly recommend it. I don’t do it at the moment. But in my early twenties when I found everything completely overwhelming, 100 percent, I did it! Are you kidding?”</p><p>She added: “I think when you’re in those moments in your life, and you want to get through them…you have to do whatever it is to help you get over it. You have to give it a go. Try anything that might help.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKKeoaKWeqy6yKCfraSVrnq0rdisZJ2ZpZy1tbHRrGSnmZ2aeqq%2FjJ6bop1dqbWmecuorZ5lmah6or%2FTqKWiq5ieu6h5kWlobmlhbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
