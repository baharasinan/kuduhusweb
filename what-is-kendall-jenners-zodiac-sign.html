She walked the runways since 2014 for Marc Jacobs and has since modeled for notable luxury brands like Chanel, Givenchy, and Victoria Secret. With her <a href=#>mile-high legs and bone structure</a>, she’s truly a “<a href=# rel=noopener>Runway Goddess</a>.” Now fans ask, has her success been written on the stars?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kendall Jenner was born on November 3, 1995, which makes her a Scorpio.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shutterstock_1131134291.jpg><p>Scroll to learn more about the model-businesswoman’s traits based on her astrological placements.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kendall Jenner as a Scorpio</h2><p>An “intense, secretive, mysterious powerhouse,” Kendall shows off her fierceness by going against the family “business” by pursuing a modeling career. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Astrotheme</a>, her dominant element is Fire, which endows her with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm. All good traits that propelled her to gain massive success in fashion.</p><p>Scorpios are known to be <a href=# rel=noopener>super dark and secretive</a> and we see that so evident in Kendall Jenner. While people find her whole brood on every screen all over the planet, Kendall prefers to keep&nbsp;everything hush hush and establish her domination of the fashion world all by herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Walking the runways and appearing in ad campaigns is her public life. But in true Scorpio fashion, Kendall is very much protective of her <a href=# rel=noopener>privacy</a>, especially with her personal and <a href=# rel=noopener>love life</a>. The old adage “still water runs deep” very much resembles Kendall’s personality.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family Background</h2><p>There’s nothing more about the <a href=#>Kardashian-Jenner</a> clan that we don’t know, right? But here are some interesting facts about Kendall (and her famous family).&nbsp;</p><p>She was born Kendall Nicole Jenner, the first daughter of <a href=#>Bruce (aka Caitlyn) and Kris Jenner</a> in Calabasas, California. Both her parents are Scorpios and we can see where Kendall got her drive to succeed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy birthday to my beautiful <a href=# rel=noopener>@kendalljenner</a>!!
