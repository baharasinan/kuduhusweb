It is unclear whether authorities were able to verify whether the clothing belonged to Lashaya Stine, as they have not disclosed any test results to the public.</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by <a href=#>Uncovered</a>, other witness reported seeing a woman, who strongly resembled Stine, in other states, including Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, and Wyoming. Some of the tipsters claimed they personally knew Stine and that she was being sexually exploited and trafficked by one particular man. Authorities have not disclosed whether they were able to verify any of the tips. However, <a href=#>The Denver Post</a> reports Sgt. Chris Poppe said most of the sightings were proven to be cases of mistaken identity.</p><p dir=ltr>In a 2019 interview with The Denver Post, Sabrina Jones said, "When a child dies and you know, you can start to heal. But when you don't know where she is and what she's going through, you're in a gray area. To me, that's worse than death. What if we never know?"</p><p dir=ltr>During the same interview, Lashaya's older brother, Shaeron, said he regrets that he and his sister often argued prior to her disappearance. He also said he regrets that he "wasn't there as much as [he] should have been." Shaeron said he hopes to see his sister again someday and that she will have an opportunity to meet his daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHBoa29mZMGpsYymsKyslae2sMHSZmlpaWZisaq%2FwKmnnpmilruksYyonWakkai1osXAZqqtoZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
