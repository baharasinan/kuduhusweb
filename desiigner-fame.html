I was a hardhead," <a href=#>he admitted to Rob Markman</a> for Genius. "I was in the streets doing dumb s***, I got hit [by a bullet] in my hip. It wasn't serious. I was in the hospital 10 minutes, 30 minutesâ€”but it was just that moment that really said, 'Yo, mind your business.' When that happened to me, I knew I wasn't supposed to be there. I always had a voice in my head that said, 'Don't do the bad.'"</p><p>He didn't go into detail about the event but does say it changed him. At that point, he made the decision to get <a href=#>out of the streets</a> and go into the studio to pursue his music.</p><p>"[Being in the streets] wasn't working for me, so I was like, you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna sell my talent," he said (<a href=#>via MTV</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5nbIFwsMSsoKKfnpq%2FbrLAppxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
