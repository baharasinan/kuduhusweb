On Saturday, Will Ospreay came to the ring and <a href=#>officially signed his contract</a>. He noted that he would not be starting with the company yet, as he had to finish up with New Japan Pro-Wrestling.</p><p>Sean Ross Sapp of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful</a> (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fightful Select</a>) reports that Ospreay’s contract is a multi-year deal. It will keep him with the company for at least three years. Sapp writes that Ospreay is still under contract with NJPW, and that will be the case through January 2024.</p><p>Per Sapp, Ospreay had informed NJPW that he was not interested in re-signing, and the company gave him their blessing to sign with AEW. The strong working relationship between AEW and NJPW paved the way for the deal to get done. Ospreay will still be able to work some dates for NJPW while he is contracted to AEW.</p><p>The report notes that talks between Ospreay and AEW picked up earlier in the fall. Ospreay previously noted that he wanted to keep living in the UK. However, he later made it clear he was willing to explore all options. Per Sapp, Ospreay will be able to stay in the UK as part of his deal with AEW.</p><h2 id=h-wwe-s-interest-in-will-ospreay>WWE’s Interest In Will Ospreay</h2><p>As previously reported, WWE was interested in landing Ospreay. Sapp writes that WWE had been in contact with Ospreay’s representation in recent weeks in an effort to gauge his interest end see what kind of schedule he would want and whether he would relocate. Per Sapp, WWE sources “had figured by this week” that Ospreay was bound for AEW.</p><p>TNA/IMPACT Wrestling was also interested in Ospreay, but it’s unclear how far the talks between the two sides got.</p><p>Catch up on our coverage of AEW Full Gear <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNram1rZGK%2FprzOq6tmnJWprqq40mamp2Wnnrmtec6sp6udka56tLXGp6Cnn12strW0jJqcsA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
