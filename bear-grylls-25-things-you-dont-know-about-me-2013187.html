Catch him on Get Out Alive with Bear Grylls on NBC, Mondays at 9 P.M.!</p><p>1. My book Mud, Sweat, and Tears was voted most influential in China last year.</p><p>2. I set the ball on fire when I threw out the first pitch at an L.A. Dodgers game!</p><p>3. I'm ambidextrous. It's helped me a few times in the wild.</p><p>4. At bath time, I get in with my three boys (Jesse, 11, Marmaduke, 6, and Huckleberry, 3, with wife Shara, 38). It's getting crowded!</p><p>5. I took my eldest tandem paragliding when he was 3 years old — no fear, just wide-eyed joy!</p><p>6. At home, I play guitar and piano.</p><p>7. I have Mike Town, my teacher from Eton College, to thank for encouraging me to climb.</p><p>8. I pick up the kids from school in an old London cab we own.</p><p>9. After filming, my crew and I usually sit at some bar in the middle of a jungle village, happy to be alive.</p><p>10. My crew is my greatest resource.</p><p>11. People ask if I eat bugs at home. No!</p><p>12. My family comes way before work.</p><p>13. I carry a picture of my family in my shoes.</p><p>14. I have an island hideaway in Wales.</p><p>15. I train six days a week, but short and sharp — 30-minute workouts.</p><p>16. I have had the same five best friends since I was 8 years old.</p><p>17. My Christian faith is my secret strength and backbone.</p><p>18. I pray every day with my children and my wife.</p><p>19. I cried when I reached the summit of Mt. Everest. Like a baby.</p><p>20. My favorite book is Unbroken by <strong>Laura Hillenbrand</strong>.</p><p>21. I had to be rescued by the coast guard when I was 8 years old.</p><p>22. My hero is my late father, who taught me to climb.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>23. I learned from my father to not listen to dream stealers.</p><p>24. My other hero is <strong>Roger Federer</strong>! He is amazing.</p><p>25. I'm inspired by the saying "Faith and fear may sail into your harbor, but only allow faith to drop anchor."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmemaJitLPFy6WqZmplYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbvNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqWVYn9xfZJqb3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
