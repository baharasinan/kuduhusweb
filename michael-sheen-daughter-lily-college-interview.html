To work with Reese… If someone says, 'Do you want to do a film with Reese Witherspoon? You go, 'Yes of course.' And then to meet (director) Hallie Meyers-Shyer and (producer) Nancy Meyers, I've loved Nancy's films, they've been amazing, and this is Hallie's first film, and it just made me think, this is great. I love the story. I love the story that it was about family, there was no bad guy in it. Although I would say that because I suppose I'm the closest thing to a bad guy in it! But I loved that about it. It seemed very warm and loving as a story, so I really looked forward to doing it."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
