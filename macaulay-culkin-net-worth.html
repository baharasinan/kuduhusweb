Macaulay Culkin became a household name after starring in a string of early smash-hit films in the 1990s, most notably "Home Alone," "Home Alone 2: Lost In New York," "My Girl," "Richie Rich," "Uncle Buck," and "The Good Son."</p><p>At the peak of his career, Culkin was one of the highest paid and most powerful actors, child or adult, in the entire movie business. We detail his salaries for his most significant films in the next section below.</p><p>Culkin took time off from acting in the late 90s and early 2000s, but has since begun appearing again in television and film roles and independent films. Macaulay has been the subject of dozens of erroneous tabloid stories about his life over the years. The media just can't seem to grasp that he is a fairly normal adult who has chosen to live his life privately away from Hollywood and magazine front pages. Fellow actor and childhood friend <a href=# title="Seth Green Net Worth">Seth Green</a> is a frequent defender of Macaualay, aka Mac. In an interview on <a href=# title="Marc Maron Net Worth">Marc Maron</a>'s podcast, Green insisted that Mac simply does not care about what the news media says about him. Mac is apparently happy to live a life with millions of dollars in the bank away from the spotlight.</p><h2 id=macaulay-culkin-salary-per-movie><strong>Macaulay Culkin Salary Per Movie</strong></h2><p>For his first major movie, 1989's "Uncle Buck," Culkin made $40,000. One year later he shot into stardom thanks to "Home Alone," for which he was paid $100,000 but which made him a household name, and for the next four years he was a seven figure movie star.</p><p>In 1991 he made $1 million for "My Girl." In 1992 he earned $4.5 million to reprise his role in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York." Following this success he actually accepted a pay cut down to $1.5 million to appear in the 1993 thriller, "The Good Son."</p><p>Then, 1994 came, and with it the peak of Culkin's earning power as a movie star. First was the film "Getting Even with Dad," which earned him $8 million, a sum he earned again for the live action cartoon adaptation "Richie Rich."</p><p>Altogether, those seven films between 1989 and 1994 earned Culkin a total of $23.5 million, which with inflation is comparable to $40 million or so today.</p><ul><li>Uncle Buck (1989): $40 thousand</li><li>Home Alone (1990): $100 thousand</li><li>My Girl (1991): $1 million</li><li>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992): $4.5 million</li><li>The Good Son (1993): $1.5 million</li><li>Getting Even with Dad (1994): $8 million</li><li>Ri¢hie Ri¢h (1994): $8 million</li></ul><p><span><strong>Total: $23.5 million</strong></span></p><p>Earning $23.5 million between 1989 and 1994 is the same as earning $40 million today after adjusting for inflation.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298963 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/mm.jpg alt width=820 height=556 sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298963 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Macaulay Carson Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in Manhattan, New York City.

In December 2013, a video that Culkin co-produced and directed of himself eating a cheese pizza went viral on YouTube. The video was meant to be a parody of <a href=# title="Andy Warhol Net Worth">Andy Warhol</a> consuming a Burger King Whopper in the documentary 66 Scenes from America. It turned out to be a promotion for the debut of The Pizza Underground, his New York-based, pizza-themed comedy rock band.
