It’s the kind of thing a parent never expects.”</p><p>The diagnosis and damage caused to Eva’s tiny body was devastating — but when she watched her younger brother take his first steps aged 18 months, she became determined to do the same.</p><p>“Her brother stood up and started to walk at one, and Eva watched him toddling around and stealing her toys, and from that moment I could see the determination in her little face,” Stacey said.</p><p>“She’s always been focused. She’s got guts and she’s got grit — that showed from a very early age.”</p><p><i><b>To support Eva and donate to help her raise vital funds for Cerebral Palsy Alliance visit <a class=body-link href=# title=www.krazykosciklimb.com.au>her page</a></b></i></p><p>Later this month, Eva will traverse Mount Kosciuszko in a wheelchair as an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Alliance. She will undertake the climb alongside her mum and aunties under the name Team Sunshine.</p><p>The team will embark on the hike just days after Eva’s first day of high school, and a few months after a corrective surgery to Eva’s hip last year.</p><p>“She’s been in a wheelchair ever since that latest surgery, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to climb,” Stacey said.</p><p>“If anything, we’ve only had to slow her down and remind her that recovery takes time.”</p><p>Team Sunshine has already raised more than $80,000 that will go towards a state-of-the-art gym facility to help with therapy for those living with cerebral palsy — and donations are still open.</p><p>Eva herself has undergone “every type of therapy imaginable” to assist in her goal, including hydrotherapy at six weeks old, physiotherapy twice every week, speech therapy and a school readiness program that her mum says was instrumental in allowing her to “live day-to-day life”.</p><p>Still, Stacey said she never doubted her daughter, describing her as “like a bull at a gate”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“I always knew she would walk,” she said.<br></p><p>“She was never going to take no for an answer.”</p><p><i>To sponsor Eva’s climb visit </i><a class=body-link href=#><i>www.krazykosciklimb.com.au/fundraisers/teameva</i></a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8eemKWsmGR%2BdMXEmqmopJRisretjKSYpaiZmba0edOoZJykmaKvbrnOrqWtZZukwKS11KyxpKddnrtuw8eenKWbmJa2s3vNnq6sZaOpvLPFjnBtaW%2BWmn91fpJynHCelmV9p4LBmm9ubpZqsXWAwGlt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
