While contestants begin the season in pods that are well-suited for quarantine, they eventually have to get out, which made shooting during the COVID-19 outbreak more difficult.</p><p>“They’re in pods and bubble pods for the first two weeks, but they then typically get out of the pods and there’s a lot of physical connection that’s part of the show,” cohost <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> told <a href=#>HollywoodLife</a> in March 2021. “And then we go back to the hometown and see if the family and friend connection match the love connection. So, we finally found a way to safely shoot the season and we are excited!”</p><p>While <a href=#>Love Is Blind‘s inaugural season was filmed</a> in Atlanta, the new episodes were filmed in Chicago. As viewers know, however, the location doesn’t much matter at the beginning. All 30 contestants spend their early days in windowless rooms, a.k.a. pods, where they can talk to their potential partners without seeing them.</p><p>After the first 10 days are over, male contestants can propose to the women they want to marry, and following the proposals, the contestants meet face-to-face for the first time. In season 1, the group then headed to Mexico for a couples retreat.</p><p>According to Vanessa, 41, her husband and cohost, <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></a>, knew instantly that the show would be a hit. “I remember vividly Nick saying in the hotel bar when we were shooting in Atlanta,” the NCIS: Hawai’i actress told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in September 2021. “He said, ‘If the show is anything like it is while we’re filming it, people are gonna be hooked,’ and [he was] right.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 98 Degrees singer, 48, and his wife haven’t offered too many hints about <a href=#>what’s to come in season 2</a>, but they did promise that it would be “juicy” — and they hinted that the wait for season 3 won’t be as long. “We shot season 3 already,” Vanessa revealed last year.</p><p>Season 2 of Love Is Blind begins streaming via Netflix on Friday, February 11.
