There were quite a few flaws that lack logic or common sense looking back today. Undertaker made the entire body of work shine to become an all-time great draw for WWE.&nbsp;However, there were just some things&nbsp;from the icon’s undefeated WrestleMania streak that made no sense.</p><h2 id=dq-finish-vs-giant-gonzalez><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>DQ Finish Vs Giant Gonzalez</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/giantgonzalez-2.jpg><p>The Undertaker had a tough task at WrestleMania IX, trying to lead the inexperienced Giant Gonzalez in a huge match.

Undertaker refused to fight Kane who continuously attacked him for months. The anger of Undertaker finally saw him having the big match at WrestleMania XIV.</p><p>Most stories with a new character having strong momentum like Kane would see him winning the first match. Undertaker winning worked out in the long run for obvious reasons, but the logic for the Kane loss was off at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=removing-nathan-jones-from-tag-match><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Removing Nathan Jones From Tag Match</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakerbigshowwm.jpg><p>Nathan Jones was someone WWE had strong hopes for when debuting him as the protégé of The Undertaker. WWE went as far as to book them in a tag match at WrestleMania XIX, knowing the streak was on the line.</p><p>The idea itself made little sense, but it was even worse when they removed Jones at the last minute to add confusion. Undertaker winning the handicap match was better for his streak, but it was confusing in 2003.</p><h2 id=big-boss-man-representing-the-corporation-against-him><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Big Boss Man Representing The Corporation Against Him</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakerbossmancell-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Undertaker feuding with Vince McMahon led to a surprising match with Big Boss Man at WrestleMania 15. WWE booked one of the early Hell in a Cell matches since Undertaker was associated with the stipulation.</p><p>Big Boss Man was not treated like a main eventer at the time making it more confusing why he was picked. Vince could have picked Kane who was in The Corporation to start the night or elevate someone with more name value at the time like Ken Shamrock. Everyone knew Undertaker was easily winning this match heading into it.</p><h2 id=king-kong-bundy-representing-million-dollar-corporation-against-him><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>King Kong Bundy Representing Million Dollar Corporation Against Him</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakerbundy.jpg><p>Another instance of The Undertaker feuding with a faction featured Ted DiBiase’s Million Dollar Corporation attempting take him down.

WrestleMania 23 featured the streak on the line against Batista’s World Heavyweight Championship in an outstanding match.</p><p>Both Batista and Undertaker were upset about getting snubbed from the main event spot. Shawn Michaels and John Cena had a great match to close the show, but the appeal of the streak and the feel-good moment of Undertaker winning the title deserved the main event.</p><h2 id=weak-build-for-match-vs-brock><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Weak Build For Match Vs Brock</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakerbrockstab.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the main reasons fans had no idea Brock Lesnar could realistically end the streak at WrestleMania XXX&nbsp;was due to how weak the build was. WWE did little to make the match feel important compared to Undertaker’s past seven matches involving the world title or personal feuds.</p><p>A few segments of the two getting violent felt rudimentary heading into the match. An argument can be made that the&nbsp;poor-build helped add to the shock of Brock ending the streak, but the interest was nowhere near the Daniel Bryan story even though it had more historical importance.</p><h2 id=refusing-to-give-shawn-michaels-a-rematch><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Refusing To Give Shawn Michaels A Rematch</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakermichaelswm26shake-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shawn Michaels had the best match of The Undertaker’s undefeated streak at WrestleMania 25. Many regard this as the best overall outing in WWE history given the impact of the two legends involved in such a masterpiece.</p><p>The story for WrestleMania 26 featured Michaels desperate for a rematch and Undertaker refusing until pushed too far. This was done to introduce the retirement stipulation for Michaels but lacked logic for Undertaker’s character. The legend refusing to fight someone who pushed him to the edge was a strange concept.</p><h2 id=demanding-triple-h-give-him-a-rematch><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Demanding Triple H Give Him A Rematch</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/undertakertriplehwm27-1.jpg><p>The opposite scenario played out in the back-to-back matches for Triple H and The Undertaker. WrestleMania 27 featured Undertaker defeating Triple H in a great match to continue the streak. However, it was another odd story of getting to the rematch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undertaker was the one who begged for a rematch since Triple H brutally beat him the prior year before losing the match.
