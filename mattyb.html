On the 13th of July 2018, for example, he uploaded a video titled “How I Broke My Arm.” MattyB has broken his arm in the video, and his buddy Kate Cadogan has come to see him with some gifts. Matty and his so-called girlfriend gave him the impression that they were dating. She brought him a handwritten card wishing him a speedy recovery and a marriage proposal. Are they dating each other, despite the fact that she has identified him as her boyfriend? MattyB has been romantically linked to the tag, although there is no confirmation that he is dating Kate Cadogen.
