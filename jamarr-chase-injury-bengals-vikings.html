Having to play without Chase going forward would be a significant blow for an offense already without quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MHPQIoyRCSO0fiiE href=#>Joe Burrow</a>. That much is obvious, but there is a history of WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TbtHrFRp7Lrr9gRR href=#>Tee Higgins</a> playing some of his best football without Chase, who missed four games last season.</p><p>Higgins said receivers coach Troy Walters told him Saturday to “be the alpha.” <a href=#>He did so in a big way.</a> The Bengals will need to channel more of that energy if Chase misses significant time. — Paul Dehner Jr., Bengals senior writer</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Ian Johnson / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGpra2plbHxzfJFsZmpqX2aDcLbAppirql2YtaK%2FxGagp6Klp8ZursSnnpqko2LDqrfIp56sZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
