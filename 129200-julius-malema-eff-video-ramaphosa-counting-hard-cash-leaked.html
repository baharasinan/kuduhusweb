The Red Berets leader took the opportunity to call out the president and stated that if Ramaphosa continues to talk too much, the video will be leaked, according to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SABC News</a></i>.</p>"There is a video which will leak. If he is talking too much it will be released. They were inside a plane counting hard cash in dollars. That is gangsterism counting. How do we have a president who counts money like he is in a taxi rank,” said Malema.<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><p class=align-left>Malema went on to say that the EFF is the only party that can stop Ramaphosa and that the party has now declared war on him. The EFF leader told supporters that the president does not pay taxes because he uses hard cash. Malema added that the money Ramaphosa was supposed to pay taxes on could have been used to build schools and houses for the population.</p><p class=align-left>Ramaphosa is currently accused of money laundering and possible tax evasion after more than R62 million in US dollars was <a href=#>stolen from his Phala Phala</a> farm in Limpopo in February 2020.

The party gave Ramaphosa 10 days to answer the questions.</p><h2>South Africans react</h2><p class=align-left>@cab_delivery said:</p>"Julius Malema needs to understand that people are tired of his gossip. Politics is what we see from Gayton MacKenzie."<p class=align-left>@SergeyLavrovSA said:</p>"Is it a crime to count cash in a ✈️??? Desperation will make people appear like fools."<p class=align-left>@ZakiMathebula said:</p>"EFF showed us two guys in the house they said those are the ones stolen millions of dollars, so can we trust them now.. we wait."<p class=align-left>@AbdullahKarabo said:</p>"Service is what people need not gossip about that video will not give us solutions to challenges we have jobs, and service delivery. Use your time wisely, Malema. Stop collecting videos."<h3>EFF Calls for Ramaphosa to step down immediately, says farm theft evidence will be manufactured</h3><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that President Cyril Ramaphosa will not face the wrath of the law which will <a href=#>work in his favour</a>, claimed Deputy President of the Economic Freedom Fighters <a href=#>Floyd Shivambu</a> and former MP Fana Mokoena.</p><p class=align-left>The pair believes that Ramaphosa may not be held accountable for the alleged cover-up of the robbery at his Phala Phala farm in Limpopo in 2020. Mokoena claimed that the police minister and the National Prosecuting Authority will protect Ramaphosa.</p><p class=align-left>The former MP said the country will hear “ridiculous stories” about why Ramaphosa can not be charged since the NPA, and police minister will avoid charging the president, <i>TimesLIVE</i> reported. He said the criminal complaint is a “mouse trap” that Ramaphosa will fight.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <i>check out news exactly <strong>for YOU </strong>➡️ find "Recommended for you" block and enjoy!</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLG7y6KropujZH5zhZFpZ2aipaG2tr%2BMppilnZ2WeqayxWatopyVpHqzrcyap6Gno5Z6pLvUp6uippditaK%2Bw2aamquYYrmmrcqem2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
