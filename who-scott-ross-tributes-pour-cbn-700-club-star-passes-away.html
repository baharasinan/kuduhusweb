Uh, but the challenges of a new culture and a number of other things, I-I walked away from the Lord for a long time."<p>Scott then revealed how he returned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>to his hometown</a> Hagerstown, Maryland (where his mom lived), to find out more about his faith in God.

The Big C’s commitment, it’s covenant. So, it’s not cancer."<p>He stressed the importance of faith and trust in times of distress:</p>"When the Lord’s talking to Jeremiah and he says, ‘I took you into a desert,’ uh look at all the times that God was quiet, he didn’t answer. That’s where trust comes in. That’s where faith comes in. And you have to hold to that. You must."<p>The Scottish reporter was known for his ability to speak candidly with famous personalities and make them feel at ease during interviews.
