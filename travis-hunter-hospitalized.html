They did well and won the game, but something unfortunate happened during the third quarter. One of their star players, “Travis Hunter” got hurt and had to go to the hospital for a check-up.</p><h2><strong>Why Was Travis Hunter Hospitalized?</strong></h2><p><strong>Hunter took an illegal hit to his abdomen during an incomplete pass at the Colorado sideline in the second quarter</strong>, however the school didn’t immediately disclose this as the reason he was declared ineligible and taken to the hospital.</p><p>You can see the incident in a tweet provided below:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A penalty is called after this hit on Travis Hunter <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9vLIUbfx6X</a></p><p>— FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 17, 2023</a></p><p>When Hunter was struck, the Rams were called for two fouls on the play. Safety After a late hit out of bounds at Hunter’s midriff, nickel back Ayden Hector was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and Henry Blackburn was called for pass interference.</p><p>Hunter, who had earlier lost a fumble that was recovered for a touchdown, came back into the game and played the whole second quarter on both offense and defense.</p><p>When Hunter was taken to the hospital, the Buffaloes were down 21-14 to the Rams, but they came back to win their third straight game. Hunter has been regarded as an early Heisman Trophy contender alongside Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders because of his versatility as a cornerback and wide receiver.</p><p>After the game, coach Deion Sanders had no additional information beyond the statement, “First thing I heard is he’s going to be out for a few weeks.” Hunter has played almost all of the Buffs’ offensive and defensive snaps this season, switching between wide receiver and cornerback.</p><p>Defensive back Shilo Sanders said:</p><p>“The bad thing about losing Travis, it’s like you’re losing two players at once.”</p><p><strong>If you want to know which other stars are hospitalized you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><p>For more information related to other stars health, injuries and more you can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and check out our other latest posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbnxyhI6tqZqumah6qcHNrZyrZZikwLG105qjorKVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
