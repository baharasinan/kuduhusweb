But alas, there is one British dignitary whose wardrobe we just cannot get enough of these days:&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh</a></strong>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The wife of the late <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>’s youngest son, <a href=#><strong>Prince Edward</strong></a>, has spent many years in the spotlight, giving her ample opportunity to nail a respectable yet chic sense of style.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Before <a href=#>marrying Edward in 1999</a>, Sophie worked in public relations. Now, she and her husband — who share daughter Lady Louise Windsor and son James, Earl of Wessex —&nbsp;spend most of their time representing the royal family at public engagements while also supporting their own charities and organizations. Like <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a> — who is married to Edward’s nephew, <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> —&nbsp;Sophie knows how to dress the part for her many official outings.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though the former secretary often favors solid ensembles, every now and again she whips out a print piece that’s to die for. When attending <a href=#>Wimbledon</a> in July 2019, she rocked a blue paisley print dress that was the perfect summer item. She also stunned in a floor-length coat dress for Christmas Day church service back in December 2017 that was truly a thing of beauty. Featuring shades of pink, blue and purple, the floral number was an absolute standout that was quite different from many of her other holiday looks.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Sophie’s holiday ensembles are always noteworthy. For Christmas Day in 2019, she kept it simple in a gray wool coat. However, she added a bit of festive appeal with a chic little red hat and purse. In 2014, she fit in her love of a print in the most subtle way possible, accessorizing her cream-colored coat with a leopard print hat.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In March 2023, Sophie looked pristine in an ivory skirt suit as she attended a Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey in London. The crisp ensemble featured a waist-cinching blazer and a flared skirt, which the U.K. native paired with a round fascinator and pointed-toe pumps.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Sophie also stood out at her brother-in-law <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>’s <a href=#>coronation</a> in May 2023. She looked beautiful at the ceremony in a cream gown by Suzannah London underneath her Royal Victoria Order Mantle.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to check out more looks from the Duchess of Edinburgh:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvSqKehoZVisLDBza2crKtdpLNuw8Ssqp6wo2K%2FsMXApWSfmaOdtrC6jKamrKxdqMG6uMisn2akn6S4tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
