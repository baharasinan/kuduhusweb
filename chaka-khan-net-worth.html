The group caught the attention of <a href=# title="Ike Turner Net Worth">Ike Turner</a>, who flew them out to L.A. to record at his music studio. Turner wished for Khan to become an Ikette and work with him, but she declined.&nbsp; In 1973, the group released their first self-titled album that included hits like "Whoever's Thrilling You" and "Feel Good." Their next album, "Rags to Rufus," was released one year later becoming a smash both commercially and critically. The same year, <a href=# title="Stevie Wonder Net Worth">Stevie Wonder</a> wrote the hit, "Tell Me Something Good" for them, which sold more than a million copies. Subsequently, Rufus scored a Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus for the song in 1974. The rest of the decade, they continued enjoying success with no less than eight platinum albums. The band gained popularity as a live performing act and Khan was the star attraction, thanks to her colorful stage attire and powerful vocals.</p><p>But in spite of their prosperity, Khan decided to leave the band and went solo in 1978. Chaka's first solo album became a global hit with the disco hit single "I'm Every Woman," which scored a number one spot and eventually becoming Khan's signature song. The song helped the album go platinum and sold over a million copies. Khan featured on <a href=# title="Quincy Jones Net Worth">Quincy Jones</a>'s 1978 hit "Stuff Like That."</p><p>The following year, Khan reunited with Rufus on the hit "Do You Love What You Feel," which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Khan released her second solo album, "Naughty" in 1980 and the album spawned the hits "Clouds" and "Papillon." Khan released two albums in 1981, one with Rufus and one solo album "What Cha Gunna Do for Me," which went gold. Two more solo albums were released the following year by Khan, and the jazz hit "Be Bop Medley" won Khan a Grammy.</p><p>In 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, "I Feel for You." The title track was the first single released and was originally written and recorded by Prince in 1979. It became a million-selling smash hit in the U.S. and the U.K and helped launch Khan into a household name. It topped the US R&B charts and remained on the chart for 26 weeks. It netted Prince the 1985 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song. Other singles off the album that helped it go platinum included "This is My Night" and "Through the Fire." In 1986, Khan was featured on <a href=# title="Steve Winwood Net Worth">Steve Winwood</a>'s 1986 number 1 hit "Higher Love."

In 1998, she signed with Prince's NPG Records and issued "Come 2 My House" and later went on a tour with Prince as a co-headlining act.</p><p>In 2007, Khan made a comeback as an older, wiser but no less soulful singer with the Grammy-winning album "Funk This." The album featured the hits "Angel" and a duet with <a href=# title="Mary J Blige Net Worth">Mary J Blige</a> "Disrespectful." The track went on to number 1 on the U.S. dance singles chart and won the singers a Grammy. "Funk This" won a Grammy for Best R&B Album. The album was also notable for a cover of Prince's "Sign o' the Times." Since, she has reignited her career and re-confirmed her status as one of the most extraordinary and enduring voices in the history of soul. In 2008, Khan participated in the Broadway adaptation of "The Color Purple." It wasn't until 2019 that she followed up "Funk This" with her 13th solo album, "Hello Happiness."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Khan was married to Hassan Khan in 1970, when she was 17.
