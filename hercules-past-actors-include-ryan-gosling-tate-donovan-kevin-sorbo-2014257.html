Check out <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>‘s top five picks of the greatest hunks to play the buff mythological man.</p><p>PHOTOS: ’90s hunks — hotter then or now?</p><p><strong>1. <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a></strong></p><p>Just a friendly reminder! Before he bared his six-pack in Crazy, Stupid, Love and impregnated Eva Mendes in real life, the Notebook heartthrob was young. And he was Hercules. Gosling starred in 49 episodes of the short-lived spinoff of Kevin Sorbo’s TV series, which aired on Fox from 1998 to 1999. A burgeoning actor at the time, the recent Mickey Mouse Club grad played the teen version of the Greek legend—loincloth and all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>And he’s proud of his work on the show! In a 2013 interview with HuffPost, Gosling, now 33, said the most underappreciated performance of his career was his work on Young Hercules. “I had a fake tan, leather pants,” he said laughing. “I was fighting imaginary monsters, they weren’t really there, but I was acting like they were there. So….”</p><p><strong>2. <a href=#>Kevin Sorbo</a></strong></p><p>Sorbo quite famously played the title role in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys from January 1995 to November 1999, and played the Greek mythological figure in several made-for-TV movies.</p><p>Sorbo, now 55, <a href=#>expressed</a> his frustration about how producers did not even offer him a cameo in The Rock’s new Hercules blockbuster. “We were sort of taken aback they wouldn’t let me in that movie,” Sorbo told Dish Nation. “I didn’t do a cameo. I think it’s kinda stupid, really… I’m still on all over America, on Netflix, on Hub, on Encore. I’m still in, like, 50 countries around the world. It was the most-watched show in the world in the ’90s, passing Baywatch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>3. <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></strong></p><p>Before Schwarzenegger became Conan the Barbarian or the Terminator, he starred in a cult favorite called Hercules in New York. The low-budget B-movie, released in 1970, was Schwarzenegger’s first-ever feature film. It tells the story of Hercules, being sent down from Mount Olympus to the Big Apple, where he begins a career as a bodybuilder. Naturally, craziness ensues and a love story pans out.</p><p>The movie is still beloved for including one of Schwarzenegger’s best movie quotes of all time. “Ha ha ha,” his character declared in the film. “You have strucked Hercules.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>4. <a href=#>Tate Donovan</a></strong></p><p>The Damages star voiced the hero in Disney’s 1997 animated musical fantasy rendition of Hercules. Donovan provided vocals for the film along with <strong>Susan Egan </strong>who played his onscreen love interest Meg, <strong>James Woods </strong>as the villainous Hades, and<strong> Danny DeVito</strong> as Philoctetes.</p><p>The feature film included the wildly popular smash song, “Go the Distance,” which unfortunately was not performed in the movie by Donovan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>5. <a href=#>Kellan Lutz</a></strong></p><p>Seven months before The Rock played demigod Hercules, Twilight actor Lutz played the same role in The Legend of Hercules.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Myths are myths,” Lutz told reporters at the January screening of the film. “To have that creative flow to make it your own—that’s why I loved working with Renny [Harlin]. He had a brilliant script. We have such a well layered movie with epic adventures. There’s great action, romance, and a brilliant cast to work with.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the movie was a box office flop (earning only $18 million in the U.S. and $61 million worldwide), but Lutz’s shirtless scenes continue to live on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tell<strong> Us</strong>: Which Hercules was your favorite?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOoZyrm6WhsrR5z5qqrWWRmMGwvtJmoKebnKqxpnnRspinZZekwK21zaBkrZmkmnqlu82orZqmXaCyt7XNZqqoqpKkenN8kG1pbm8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
