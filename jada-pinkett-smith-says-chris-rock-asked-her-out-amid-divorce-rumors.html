And this particular summer, Chris, he thought that we were getting a divorce,” Pinkett Smith, 52, told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>People</i></a> in an interview published on Wednesday, October 11. “So he called me and basically he was like, ‘I’d love to take you out.’”</p><p class=p1>Pinkett Smith noted that she was confused as to why Rock, 58, was trying to date her considering she was married to Smith, 55.</p><p class=p1>“He was like, ‘Well, aren’t you and Will getting a divorce?’ I was like, ‘No. Chris, <a href=#>those are just rumors</a>,’” she told the outlet. “He was appalled. And he profusely apologized and that was that.”</p><p class=p1>Rock has not publicly responded to Pinkett Smith’s claims, which according to <i>People</i>, will be further detailed in <a href=#>her upcoming <i>Worthy</i> memoir</a>.</p><p class=p1>Pinkett Smith and the <a href=#><i>King Richard </i></a>star started dating in 1995, ultimately <a href=#>getting married two years later</a>. Smith — who <a href=#>coparents</a> son Trey, 30, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Sheree Zampino</strong></a> — and Pinkett Smith share son <a href=#>Jaden</a>, 25, and daughter <a href=#>Willow</a>, 22.</p><p class=p1>While Pinkett Smith did not disclose when Rock tried to take her out on a date, <a href=#>she did separate from Smith in 2016</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I think, by the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying,” she told <i>Today </i>on Wednesday. “I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.”</p><p class=p1>Pinkett Smith and Smith have yet to file for divorce but still live apart. “I think just not being ready yet,” she added on<i> Today</i>. “Still <a href=#>trying to figure out between the two of us</a> how to be in partnership, right, and in regards to how do we present that to people, you know? And we hadn’t figured that out.”</p><p class=p1>Amid Pinkett Smith and Smith’s separation, they came <a href=#>face to face with Rock again at the Academy Awards</a> last year. Rock made a joke about Pinkett’s shaved head, which is a result of <a href=#>her alopecia battle</a>, while presenting at the Oscars in March 2022.</p><p class=p1>Smith, who<a href=#> implored Rock to keep Pinkett Smith’s name</a> “out [his] f—king mouth,” then walked up on the stage and <a href=#>smacked Rock</a>. While Pinkett Smith was initially floored by the now-infamous slap, <a href=#>Smith has since apologized</a>. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also <a href=#>banned Smith from their events</a> for 10 years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“It was in the heat of the moment and it was him overreacting. He knows that, she knows that. They’re in agreement that he overreacted,”<a href=#> a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i></a> in April 2022, noting Pinkett Smith “wishes” her spouse hadn’t hit Rock.</p><p class=p1>The insider added at the time: “She’s not one of these women that needs protecting. He didn’t need to do what he did, she didn’t need protecting. She’s not a wallflower. She’s a strong woman, an opinionated woman and she can fight her own battles. But she will stand by him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZSWerG1zaScraxdqLqqwMdmqpqxo2Kwqb7IrGSrp5OgeqK%2Fyp6bZqCVp3qwwdNmmKahlGKxqsLOq5qeZaKqurC%2B0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
