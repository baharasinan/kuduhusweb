One fawning fan likened DC’s poaching of the Guardians of the Galaxy filmmaker from Marvel to the MCU stealing Batman, to which Gunn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">graciously and humbly accepted</a> the comparison to the heavyweight superhero. Let’s hope it doesn’t go to his head, though, as he does now have the power to fire Pattinson and cast himself in The Batman 2.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>30 years later, the reason Terminator 2 had 16 times the budget of the first one is finally clear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/terminator-2-judgement-day.jpg><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>Everyone knows that the Terminator series is less of a franchise and more two fantastic films followed by several underwhelming sequels.

That’s the case with 2017’s 2:22, starring Michiel Huisman and Teresa Palmer, about an air traffic controller who is plagued by the same star-filled vision every day at the exact same time. Despite its lackluster execution, it seems this intriguing mystery is enough to get people to give the flick a go as 2:22 is currently finding itself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking off on streaming this week</a>.</p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>Stay tuned tomorrow for more of the latest sci-fi news around, cinephiles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8uaq56rpGLApLWMn6BmppWswG62wKacrGWXqruvecCdpKKso2K1pr%2BMnZqsZaKarq15y6KdnmWSlsGurc1mmKxloqSvpr7TZqearKSeu7S7zWaeqKGenHq0tMirq6Wdo6h6qrrCoqueq12arrO42GamrJuRp3q1rcukZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
