However, that might not be happening anytime soon judging by what’s been happening recently.</p><p>While speaking on the latest episode of the&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping It 100</a>,&nbsp;Konnan talked about Iyo Sky’s current status in WWE. Konnan stated Sky’s character lacks charisma and interest. making it clear he isn’t a fan of Sky.</p><p>“She has no charisma, and I am into her storyline now, well I was into it because she just cashed in that Money In The Bank thing. But they are separating her and Bayley and it’s kind of funny how her and Bayley were going back and forth and doing one-upmanship, but yeah, she’s not an interesting character whatsoever. She hasn’t been interesting to me on viewing that show, period.”</p><p>Iyo Sky isn’t featured on WWE Payback’s card and it remains ot be seen how long she will reign as the WWE Women’s Champion, as some fans feel she didn’t deserve to become the champion.</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>Are you in agreement with what Konnan had to say about Iyo Sky?
