One year after the pair’s Georgia nuptials, the couple began growing their family.</p><p><a href=#>Twins Chandler and Sawyer arrived</a> in April 2016, <a href=#>followed by Hunter and Tyler</a> in August 2018 and July 2020, respectively. Kelly wrote via Instagram when their youngest arrived that their family was “complete.”</p><p>Between the births of Hunter and Tyler, the former cheerleader had surgery to remove a brain tumor after being diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. This condition is characterized by noncancerous, slow-growing tumors along the branches of the eighth cranial nerve.</p><p>“There was a 50 percent chance I would lose my hearing. There was a chance I’d lose facial function,” the Georgia native wrote of the surgery in an October 2019 <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a> essay. “It was all really scary. … It wasn’t easy after. I needed to relearn how to walk.”</p><p>Kelly praised her “incredible” husband at the time, writing, “He was literally by my side at every step. I had exercises I needed to do — some of them were seemingly simple, like shaking my head left and right — and Matthew helped me through all of it.”</p><p>She concluded by assuring fans that she felt “pretty good,” adding, “Days are longer. Some days are hard — some mornings I wake up a little foggy, and know I have to take the day a little slower. It’s rarer for me to get dizzy. Background noise can be tough (but also good — sometimes I don’t hear what I don’t want to hear). … The doctors said it would take about a year for me to feel symptom-free and have the same energy I had before.”</p><p>One year later, Kelly reflected on her procedure via Instagram, writing that she would “never be the same.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She explained, “I have symptoms that are still lingering. In fact, they aren’t symptoms anymore. They are just a part of me. But every time I get those headaches, lose my footing or get yelled at by my girls for not listening when I really never heard them, I remind myself how much stronger I am. How much stronger my marriage is. How much stronger my family is. It was a part of God’s plan, a plan I am all in for. Grateful to be here.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Kelly and Matthew’s best moments over the years with <a href=#>twins</a> Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter and Tyler, from Halloween costumes to winter vacations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNku6e40makmqyknbK4edKtmJ%2Ben6exbrfEpaOyZZiWua2%2FjJ%2BYpqGcrnqiuMGupGaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
