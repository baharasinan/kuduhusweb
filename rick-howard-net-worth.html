The Canadian-born is considered to be one of the pioneers of reinventing switch skateboarding. Howard is also the founder of chain a companies – generating an impressive net worth. Howard started out with as a skater for Blockhead Skateboard. At this point, Howard was a well-seasoned pro and went on to stake for Gullwing Trucks, Plan B Skateboard and Independent Trucks. At Plan B, Howard was hailed a legend. He was featured on the video, Virtual Reality, displaying techniques that were never seen in the history of skateboarding. Not only he became a legend to admiring skateboard fanatics, Howard was also hailed a fashion icon for wearing a short-sleeve check shirt in the same video.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356161 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rick-howard.jpg alt width=900 height=635 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356161 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for HBO)</p><p>Howard took skateboarding to another level and set up a Crailtap Distribution Company, which comprises Four Star Clothing, Royal Trucks, Chocolate Skateboards, Girl Skateboards (which he set up with friends <a href=#>Spike Jonze</a>, <a href=# title="Mike Carroll Net Worth">Mike Carroll</a> and Megan Baltimore); Lakai footwear (a business venture with Mike Carroll.) Howard set out to launch the shoe company (designed for skateboarding) after he was sponsored by DC Shoes. Under Lakai Footwear, Howard was a producer of a number of street skateboarding videos – one of which includes the award-winning Fully Flared (2007). Howard was also amongst the host of pro-skateboarders in the 90 minute feature film. Howard showed off his new techniques that were (once again) admired by thousands of die-hard fans. In the year of its release, Fully Flared received awards from Transworld Skateboarding and the Skateboard magazine for Best Video of the Year. The hard work certainly paid off as Fully Flared –the first feature film by Howard- took four years to perfect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeinrCseceorpqqlGK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
