When asked about the parody, Johnson couldn’t contain his laughter.</p><p>“These Vin Diesel jokes — which play great, by the way, to the audience, which is always a good thing because it’s all about them — people think these jokes come from me and they actually don’t,” the former wrestler explained on Monday. “You’d be surprised with how many people come to me with, ‘I’ve got a great one. I’ve got another great Vin Diesel joke.’ I’m sure you do. [They’re] always funny.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Jumanji actor</a> first butted heads publicly with Diesel in August 2016 when <a href=#>Johnson posted a since-deleted Instagram post</a> calling some of his <a href=#>Fast and the Furious</a> costars “candy asses.”</p><p>Rumors swirled that <a href=#>he was referring to Diesel</a>, who has played Dominic Toretto in the racing franchise since 2001. Johnson, for his part, joined the cast as Hobbs in 2015’s Fast Five.</p><p>Three years later, the actors appeared to have buried the hatchet with Johnson thanking Diesel for the success of Hobbs & Shaw. “Lastly, but not least, want to thank brother Vin for your support of Hobbs & Shaw,” he wrote via Instagram in September 2019. “I’ll be seeing you soon, Toretto.”</p><p>However, the feud was reignited in June when Diesel told Men’s Health that <a href=#>creating the Hobbs character required “tough love” on his part</a>.</p><p>“That took a lot of work,” the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy actor</a> told the magazine, explaining how his role as producer required him to really focus on Johnson’s acting style. “We had to get there and sometimes, at that time, I could give a lot of tough love. Not Fellini-esque, but I would do anything I’d have to do in order to get performances in anything I’m producing.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Moana</a> star revealed the following month that he <a href=#>would not be returning to the Furious franchise</a> after being noticeably absent from F9. He also commented on Diesel’s remarks, telling The Hollywood Reporter in July that he “laughed hard” after learning what he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Looking back, the <a href=#>Jungle Cruise</a> actor <a href=#>does have one regret over his part in the feud</a> — releasing the initial Instagram post.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have shared that,” Johnson told Vanity Fair earlier this month. “Because at the end of the day, that goes against my DNA. I don’t share things like that. And I take care of that kind of bulls—t away from the public. They don’t need to know that. That’s why I say it wasn’t my best day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuwmamjsm62zqGlrKeeYryvedWipWacmZrApriMq5ydZZ6kwaqvxGahqKOVqHq1tMSyZKedppq%2FbrHNnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
