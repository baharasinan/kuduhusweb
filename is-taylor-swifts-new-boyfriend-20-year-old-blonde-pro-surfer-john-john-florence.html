Of course she does, even if her people are denying the reports already. I tend to think Swifty is one of those girls who constantly needs to have a “crush” on someone, but not necessarily be in a relationship. Her M.O. seems to be: crush on a guy for a while, finally get the guy, go completely insane over the guy, make the guy pose for photo-ops within a few days of officially “dating”, buy property close to the guy, meet the guy’s family and then, after two weeks have passed, get dumped by the guy over the phone. Then she spends a month or two stalking him after he dumped her, and then she writes some songs about him and then she’s on to the next one.</p><p>Anyway, Swifty and Harry Styles broke up in early January. She’s been due for a new crush/boyfriend for a while. And she might have found the crush with super-blonde surfer John John Florence, and I’m not even joking about his name. His name is John John Florence. He’s 20 years old and a pro surfer. Here he is:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/john-john.jpg alt title="john john" width=540 sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Skin damage from too much sun and salt water, yes. But he’s a cute guy with beautiful eyes and he has the kind of hair Taylor looks for in potential boyfriends. One of her biggest priorities is “hair”. The rumor mill went into overdrive when tabloids reported that John John and Taylor have been flirting and texting with each other. John John even seemed to hint at a relationship in a recent interview, but Swifty’s people are trying to shut it down:</p><p>It doesn’t sound like Taylor Swift is angling to catch a wave with John John Florence. Rumor has it that the 23-year-old singer recently initiated contact with rather adorable 20-year-old pro surfer and that the pair have been growing closer via text message ever since. Or not.</p><p>Sources assure E! News that “there is no truth to this at all,” and that “Taylor is not dating—or texting—this guy.”</p><p>She could do worse than the Hawaiian-born Florence, who won the Vans World Cup of Surfing in 2011, but it does seem far-fetched that she’d be embarking on such a thing at this time.</p><p>Swift is on her way to Charlotte, N.C., having just kicked off her Red Tour last week. And, last we checked, that’s a long way from Hawaii.</p><p>The romantic tale appears to have been spurred on by Florence’s response when an Australian TV reporter asked him two weeks ago during a surfing event in Queensland if he could provide some insight into “a little bit of something” she had heard about him and Swift.</p><p>“Yeah, you know, it’s kind of a secret thing going on right now,” he replied, smiling. “Can’t bust it out in the public just yet.”</p><p><a href=#>[From E! News]</a></p><p>Sounds like Taylor has John John on the backburner and right now she’s focused on her tour. My guess is she’s going to get with Ed Sheeran while they tour together and then she’ll get with John John a few months from now. Surprise! They were texting each other the whole time.</p><p>Here’s video of John John surfing:</p><p></p><p><a href=#>DONE Trailer 2</a> from <a href=#>John John Florence</a> on <a href=#>Vimeo</a>.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/john2.jpg alt title=john2 width=566 height=341 sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wenn20211849.jpg alt title=wenn20211849 width=550 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3BnZ4Zye8islq2ZqaG8s6vSsKCfrKOUu6bDvpumsp6inrKvsL5rZ2axlZa%2FbrvLnZabpJ%2Bjsaarz6umZqulp7Omvr6jpqGmj5%2B8qbq%2Bn6OoqpWjsKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
