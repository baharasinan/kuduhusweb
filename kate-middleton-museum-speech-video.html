Kate, 37, was given a new patronage at the London-based museum. The speech was delivered with much confidence and ease, seven years after her first speech when she opened the Treehouse hospice in Ipswich back in March 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7d565ac8093-kate-middleton-event-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eUhQO1q4CXRc data-wc=8><strong>Duchess Kate at the Foundling Museum on Tuesday</strong></p><p id=etbEVnBnrWHJ data-wc=88>On Tuesday, the Duchess admitted it could be "quite intimidating" for children and teenagers to visit institutions if they "don't know it's for them", saying they only needed to step inside to find programmes and exhibitions created with them in mind. She also spoke of her passionate belief in the "power of art", saying: "By weaving together the moving stories of looked after children, with art and artists of all genres, you create meaningful learning experiences which will have a lasting, and often transformational, impact on young lives."</p><p id=ey1ua-8ClUAM data-wc=1><strong>GALLERY: <a class=hm-link href=#>All the pictures from the Queen and Kate's first joint engagement</a></strong></p><p style=text-align:center id=eFd5n3Ip1Afy data-wc=6><strong>WATCH THE SPEECH IN VIDEO BELOW</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eeYuquuA6cN1 data-wc=144>The Duchess is already patron of the V&A and National Portrait Gallery, and now becomes a public advocate for the Foundling Museum in Bloomsbury, which tells the story of the Foundling Hospital - the UK's first children’s charity and public art gallery - and today works with children in care. In a speech shortly after her patronage was announced, she said: "Your work connects and celebrates two subjects that are deeply important to me: children, and art. I am passionate about improving children’s life chances and giving them opportunities, so that they can look forward to the best possible futures, fulfil their whole potential, and have the freedom to explore their creativity." She added: "I have always believed in the power of art, not only to unlock that creativity, but also to bring us joy, and to inspire, challenge and positively change our lives."</p><p id=enTzypjw6_vY data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>The royal family's most romantic gestures</a></strong></p><p id=empVshiuimZN data-wc=23></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
