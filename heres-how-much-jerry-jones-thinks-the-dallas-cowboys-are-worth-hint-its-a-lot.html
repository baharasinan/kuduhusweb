But the team has turned its season around, racking up three straight wins. They now sit atop the NFC East and control their own playoff destiny.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The wins likely make America's Team even more valuable – especially if you ask <a href=# rel=noopener>Jerry Jones</a>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Cowboys owner recently said in an interview that he thinks the Cowboys are worth </span><b>$10 billion</b><span style=font-weight:400>. And he has no plans to sell them anytime soon.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Check out what Jones had to say:</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-273020 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1038687378.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-273020 class=wp-caption-text>Otto Greule Jr/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"If I had to sell the team tomorrow I wouldn't accept anything less than $10 billion. But I don't want to imply that I would take $10 billion for them. The Cowboys are just not for sale. They're a long-term asset and my immediate family – which has been a part of making them what they are today – they'll own the Cowboys long after I'm gone."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jones added that he doesn't think $10 billion is unreasonable, and he'd rather have the Cowboys than the money. And with exciting players like <a href=# rel=noopener>Ezekiel Elliott</a> and <a href=# title="Amari Cooper Net Worth">Amari Cooper</a>, it makes sense to hold onto his investment.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>By his estimate, the Cowboys are worth more than double than any other franchise. Is that crazy? Probably. But the Cowboys are already among the most valuable sports franchises in the world. And the more they keep winning, the more valuable they'll become.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqGcq52jYrWww4ymrJygXZ%2Bys77YZqGoppWoerW0yKeirGWknbJusMClo5qrXZi8uK7OsqpmmaKaeri70a2fZqCZo8FutdOsZJplnKTBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
