But despite how popular Cosby was in those two decades, he reached another level of fame in the '80s with "The Cosby Show." During the series, which ran on NBC <a href=#>from 1984 to 1992</a>, the comedian played Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, an OB/â€‹GYN, a wise father, and an all-around good guy.&nbsp;But that image would be decimated after a number of women&nbsp;said that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them, and as <a href=#>USA Today</a> reported, the number of accusers grew to 60.</p><p dir=ltr>At first, it didn't seem that Cosby would be charged for the alleged acts due to statute of limitation laws but that changed after a Temple University worker named Andrea Constand testified that he drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia home in 2004, per&nbsp;<a href=#>NBC News</a>. According to <a href=#>CNN</a>, Cosby was then charged with three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault and was sentenced to 3-10 years of prison in 2018. But in June of 2021, the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court <a href=#>overturned Cosby's ruling</a>, partially because a prosecutor made a deal with Cosby years ago and said he wouldn't prosecute him if he agreed to give a&nbsp;deposition in Constand's civil case, according to the <a href=#>AP</a>.&nbsp;Cosby was released from Pennsylvania's SCI Phoenix on Wednesday, June 30, 2021, after serving more than two years of his sentence.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
