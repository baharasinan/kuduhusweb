Others want Armstrong back on the job.</p><p>The Oakland Police Commissioners, who were set to hold a disciplinary meeting on the chief, respected the Mayor’s decision to release Armstrong without cause, saying in a statement that they were sorry to lose an influential reform-minded head who led the OPD into compliance in 51 out of 52 tasks of the negotiated settlement agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>The OPD has been under federal oversight for two decades.&nbsp;In a new written statement, Armstrong says he is continuing to evaluate his legal options to preserve his rights and hard-earned reputation.</p><p>Advocates are now pointing fingers at the Mayor, saying that their voices were ignored in the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayor Thao declined to comment on Armstrong Thursday. Another rally in support of Armstrong is scheduled for Monday morning at Oakland City Hall.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC7wKSjmqaUYr2wuMicnGabmJ6yp3nLnqmopp6aeqK%2BzKyrq6eenHqir8Kuqp6cXaSzbrnIrJqoppSqsLV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
