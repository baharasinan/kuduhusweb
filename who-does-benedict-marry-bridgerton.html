Season two was all about Anthony Bridgerton’s complicated love story with Kate Sharma. And now, amid all the frenzy over “Polin” — Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton — there’s another Bridgerton sibling waiting to find his true love.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While Benedict Bridgerton’s love story is the focus of the third novel in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia Quinn’s Bridgerton book series</a>, Netflix opted for a different route. Instead of seeing book three, An Offer From a Gentleman, play out, Netflix’s third season is based on book four, Romancing Mister Bridgerton. Thus, the show has introduced us to a new love interest for Benedict in the form of Lady Tilley Arnold, a wealthy widow who he starts a physical relationship with. But, who will Benedict actually end up with?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/bridgerton-stars-dating-real-life.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l lrv-u-text-align-center">Who does Benedict marry in Bridgerton?</h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In Julia Quinn’s book series, Benedict Bridgerton marries Sophie Beckett, the daughter of an Earl who ends up working for the Bridgerton family, in Cinderella-like love story that fans are hoping plays out in season four of the Netflix show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, the show is known to deviate from the books so who knows what direction Benedict, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who is played by Luke Thompson</a>, will take in his quest for love on-screen.</p><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l lrv-u-text-align-center">Benedict Bridgerton marries Sophie Beckett at the end of the third ‘Bridgerton’ book.</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In An Offer From a Gentlemen, Benedict becomes entranced by a mystery woman who attends a masquerade ball hosted by the Bridgertons. She exits the ball, leaving behind a glove, before Benedict can catch her name. He becomes infatuated and vows to find her. What he doesn’t know is that Sophie is the illegitimate daughter of an Earl who is forced to be a servant to her stepmother and stepsisters after her father’s death.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Two years after Benedict first meets Sophie, a skew of circumstances lead to her becoming Violet Bridgerton’s maid, all without Benedict realizing she’s the woman he met at the ball.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The pair form a romantic connection all while Benedict is still hoping to reunite with the woman from the ball. Eventually (thankfully) he puts two and two together, realizing Sophie is the woman he has been looking for all along.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">They marry and go on to welcome four children together: Charles, Alexander, William, and Violet.</p><h3 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-secondary-l lrv-u-text-align-center">Will Benedict and Sophie marry in Bridgerton season four?</h3><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">So far, Sophie and Benedict’s love story has not began in the Netflix adaptation of the show. However, fans have speculated that we may be introduced to Sophie in the final episodes of season three. In season three, Anthony tells Eloise that she needs to hire a new maid, which fans suspect could end up being Sophie, though this would differ from the plot of the original book.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to one fan on TikTok, paparazzi photos taken during the filming of the season three finale, showed a new maid getting into a carriage with one of the Bridgerton sisters.</p><a title=@aynsley_broom href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@aynsley_broom</a> Replying to @h🫶🏾 I am VERY intrigued by this theory! Putting the pieces together it is very likely that Masali Baduza is Sophie Beckett and Bendict Bridgerton’s season is next. BUT I have been wrong before, so we shall see what unfolds in Season 3!👀 <a title=bridgerton href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#bridgerton</a> <a title=benedictbridgerton href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#benedictbridgerton</a> <a title=benophie href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#benophie</a> <a title=sophiebeckett href=# rel="noopener nofollow">#sophiebeckett</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Aynsley Broom" href=# rel="noopener nofollow">♬ original sound – Aynsley Broom</a><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fans believe this maid is South African actress Masali Baduza who could be playing Sophie next season.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bridgerton showrunners have not confirmed whether Bridgerton season four will focus on Benedict and Sophie but they have been open about altering details from Quinn’s books.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We already differ from the books a little bit because we’re an ensemble show,” showrunner Jess Brownell <a href=#>told Variety in May 2022</a> after it was revealed that Benedict’s love story would not appear in season three. “The books really focus on one on one romantic pair at a time and maybe the siblings have a little cameo here and there but they don’t have full stories. In that way, even though we’re reversing the order of the books, I think all the people you would expect to see — Benedict, who is book three, he will be a vital part of Season 3.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She also hinted that some elements of the siblings’ love stories could be altered to fit into plans to have eight seasons. “I think [Bridgerton creator] Shonda Rhimes has said publicly before that she wants to have eight seasons. We hope to get to tell every sibling’s love story and they will always be in each season.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see all the most talked-about relationship and sex scenes in ‘Bridgerton.’</strong><br><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async width=693 height=390 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/bridgerton-code.png alt sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoa2BpfnKBj2iuoaddmbymv4ybnKedlJ6wtXnMmqmrsV2Xv6qwxp6praeeZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
