David Lee Murphy's "Dust on the Bottle" is a classic country love song about a man named Creole Williams who lives down a dirt road and makes homemade wine like nobody else the singer knows. On a Friday night when the singer needs advice on treating his girl right, he visits Creole Williams for help. Creole offers him some wine from his cellar, reassuring him that although there might be a little dust on the bottle, the contents are still as good as ever.</p><br><p>As the story progresses, the singer and his girl sit by the lake, watching the sunset, and enjoying the wine he got from Creole. Even after all these years, they're still together, making memories and enjoying each other's company. The singer reflects on how good love is like a fine wine – it gets better with age. The song's message is that even though there may be imperfections and blemishes, it's the content that counts, and with love, good things only get better as time goes on.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Creole Williams lived down a dirt road</u><br>The singer introduces and describes Creole Williams' rural and secluded living situation.</p><br><p><u>Made homemade wine like nobody I know</u><br>The singer describes Creole's wine-making skills, which he regards as unique and remarkable.</p><br><p><u>Dropped by one Friday night and said, "Can you help me, Creole?
