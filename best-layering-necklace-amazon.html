The first is a fourteen-inch paperclip chain choker with a two-inch extension to allow a comfortable fit around the neck. The other is an eighteen-inch, thin paperclip chain necklace with an embellished hexagon personalized pendant on one side and a heart engraved on the back for only you to feel against your skin like a warm embrace. “I like that it’s two different necklaces, so it’s optional if you just want to wear one or both!” said a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">happy shopper</a>, “It’s so beautiful! I would recommend it to anyone as a gift for themselves!”</p><p>You can choose to place the initials of a lover, child or friend on the front to feel close to them, create a conversation starter — or even place the first or last initial of your name on the front. Even <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a> has jumped on the trend, with three tiny pendants on a gold chain proudly displaying the first letters of her children’s names: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis (without their titles, of course). It’s endearing and heartwarming to see her love on display.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">M MOOHAM Dainty Gold Necklace </span></a>for 20% off at Amazon right now — just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$12</a>!
