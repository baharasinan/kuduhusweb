He then used the wood glue to glue the top and bottom round panels onto the dome.</p><p>“After that, he measured and cut the dowels with a hand saw and once we glued the dowels on together, working side-by-side, he sanded the entire table.”</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=035d61121f32fe29d3643304addbc638 data-tgev-label=lifestyle data-tgev-metric=ev>$20 Bunnings fix to stop nosy neighbours</a></b></p><p>Chantelle then completed the look by applying three coats of the Monocel Clear Timber Varnish also from <a class=body-link href=# rel=nofollow title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=bunnings data-tgev-label=topics data-tgev-metric=ev>Bunnings</a>.</p><p>Chantelle said she has always been inspired by home decor and with Zach’s skill working on high-end projects, they tried their luck not realising how good it would turn out.</p><p>“I was so happy with it even before we applied the varnish. I just kept telling Zach ‘I am so in love with it’ and it’s now sitting exactly where I wanted it to in the living room.”</p><p>“I know if we bought the one for $3,500 I probably wouldn’t have felt as good because of the price. But it definitely feels way better when you know you’ve made it yourself.”</p><p>The 22-year-old, who works in sales for a contractor management company, said Zach was also super proud, telling all his tradie mates all about it at work, particularly after the massive reaction it got on <a class=body-link href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Chantell shared a time lapse video of DIY project on the social media platform on Thursday and it has already clocked 1.8 million views.</p><p>“Looks better than the expensive one actually,” one user commented.</p><p>“OK I would buy your version,” another person added, while a third said: “This is some talent right there!! Amazing work!!”</p><p>Chantelle said she was “so shocked” by the positive response, saying she “freaked out” when it hit 100,000 views that night, let alone over a million the following day.</p><p>“I can’t believe a home job DIY coffee table has blown up... who would have thought.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Bunnings data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Bunnings</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Kmart data-tgev-order=2 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Kmart</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=TikTok data-tgev-order=3 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>TikTok</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8eopJ5nlJ7GcLPOpZtmm5%2BWwLV5wqisqaSVYrSwedWiqZqkXaTDpr6MnaCyZZKqu6%2B1zaCqZqOdlr%2B1ecKonZ%2BdlWLBoq7LnmannaeoerTAzquwaGtjaoBzsZibaGmdlpixcX2WmppummJlfnWvlJyZb5th</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
