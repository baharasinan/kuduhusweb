Fans still appreciate the last contest that was booked to break their 1-1 tie.</p><p>The Pacquiao vs Bradley Jr. trilogy took place in 2016. This was the first fight for the Senator after his high-voltage bout against Floyd Mayweather in 2015. Given his resume,&nbsp;‘Pacman’ was an obvious favorite for his fight against Bradley Jr.</p><p>Pacquiao won this fight fair and square with a unanimous decision. He administered a classic beating to ‘Desert Storm’ for 36 minutes to claim a monumental win. The judges scored the contest 116-110, 116-110, and 116-110 in <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>favor</a> of the veteran.</p><p>Later, Boxing Scene revealed Compubox’s punch stats for this trilogy. Here, the final punch stat <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>report</a> showed Pacquiao as the ultimate winner as he remained successful in landing his power shots, jabs, and total punches. On the other hand, Bradley Jr. didn’t seem in his element as he wasn’t striking his contemporary well.</p><p>For their efforts, both the fighters took home a substantial fight purse from this encounter. While Pacquiao made a guaranteed $20 million for this fight, Bradley Jr. made <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>$4</a> million.</p><p>Unfortunately, the PPV numbers weren’t really impressive. Top Rank boss, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Bob Arum</a>, who was ‘Pacman’s promoter, spoke to <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>ESPN</a>&nbsp;about the PPV numbers. He said, “It will be somewhere between those numbers, 400,000 and 500,000. It’s all being added up, but it will be closer to 400,000 than 500,000. Terrible.”</p><p>Despite the embarrassing PPV numbers, this fight worked wonders for Pacquiao, who was eager to resurrect his position.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Manny Pacquiao avenged his loss to Timothy Bradley Jr.</h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Pacquiao</a> and Bradley Jr. met each other for the first time in 2012. Here, ‘Desert Storm’ won the fight with a split decision. However, the Philippine fighter made a roaring comeback with two wins in 2014 and 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-520120346-2.jpg><p>As overcoming adversities, facing someone as skilled as Bradley Jr., and conquering him were no mean feat, these wins are etched among Pacquiao’s all-time best wins.</p><p>How well do you remember the fight?</p><p><strong>Watch this story – <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Anderson Silva vs. Tito Ortiz Stats: Age, Record, Reach, Height and Knockout Ratio</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Gor6Kml2K7psPSZq6hp12svK95zJqlp7Fdpa6kvdSimKhlpqh6tbXMqKuhsV2Xv6Kwy56wZqKiYoBuvsSsrKWso2LApLvRnpqaqpSoerTAwK2qZqilp8Cmv4yapZ1loKXDbq7Usqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
