She maintained that Vivid Entertainment, the same company that released <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>’s recorded romp with <strong>Ray J</strong>, got hold of the footage and reached out to the couple to make a deal. In order to profit from the tape, Mimi claimed at the time that she and Nikko were required to film extra scenes to meet Vivid’s minute requirement.</p><p>The truth? Nikko thought that their lovemaking was like art, and that it needed to be documented for the public eye. Despite her reservations, Mimi went along with it.</p><p>“We had to say something,” Mimi admits, regarding the lies. “I didn’t tell anybody the truth.”</p><p>After a nasty and highly publicized break up with her ex-boyfriend, noted record producer <strong>Stevie J</strong>, Mimi was vulnerable and quite frankly, “f—ed up,” she says. Nikko and Mimi, old pals, rekindled their relationship in 2012. At first, Nikko, 39, was a shoulder to lean on — a “friend, understanding to what was going on”…with great sex to boot. Time revealed that he had a motive…and a wife of 10 years, Margeaux.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Love-and-Hip-Hop-Atlantas-Mimi-Faust-Reveals-Sex-Tape-Was-Staged-All-Along-%E2%80%94-Watch-1.jpg><p>The 43-year-old mom ignored her intuition, even when Nikko’s true intentions were crystal-clear.</p><p>“Every time I would go to Nikko’s place, there would be a camera and a tripod in front of the bed at all times,” she remembers. “You know how you get that gut feeling? I didn’t listen to my gut instinct. I kind of just shoved it to the side.”</p><p>When the tape hit the ‘net in 2014, <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ reported</a> that the couple raked in more than $400,00 in pre-sales. Tongues were wagging (and plenty of memes were made) about Mimi and Nikko’s wild sexcapades…specifically, her balancing act on a shower rod.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mimi says that she’s still cashing in from the video — “I get a check every quarter for the rest of my life,” she divulges — but ultimately, it’s still a big regret.</p><p>“Stupid decision? Yes,” Mimi reflects. “I wish I could take it back.”</p><p>Tune in to this week’s episode of VH1’s Love & Hip Hop Atlanta on Monday at 8 p.m. EST for more of Mimi’s big confession!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOpaavnV2Wu6V5x6KnZqCfpcBuucimoGaekarAtXnAnaSirKNiwKbEjK2YqZ1drK60edKtmKCdlGJ%2FcX2Ua2lv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
