How much does he make per movie?</p><p><strong>Keanu Reeves’ salary has varied greatly throughout his career. He was paid $95,000 for his role in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, compared to the $250 million he reportedly made from the two “Matrix” sequels. Much of his wealth has come from box office profit-sharing.</strong></p><p>For more on Keanu Reeves’ career in movies and how much money he has made, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bill & Ted</h2><p>For many viewers, their first exposure to Keanu Reeves was in 1989’s “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, where he played Theodore “Ted” Logan.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The film became a cult comedy classic</a>, spawning a sequel, “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” a couple of years later, as well as a second sequel, “Bill & Ted Face the Music” more than thirty years later.</p><p>As one of his first roles, Reeves’ portrayal of Ted did not net him the millions he would enjoy later in his career. <a href=# rel=noopener>He was paid a reported $95,000 dollars for the role</a>, an impressive amount for a young actor but one he would later greatly surpass.</p><p>Money clearly isn’t the primary motivator for Reeves, who famously (and probably wisely) turned down a role in 1997’s “Speed 2: Cruise Control”, <a href=# rel=noopener>leaving a reported $12 million on the table in the process.</a></p><p>While Reeves is a professional actor, he is evidently not a greedy one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Matrix</h2><p>After a relatively mixed spell in the mid-1990s, Reeves starred alongside Al Pacino in the well-received “The Devil’s Advocate” in 1997. <a href=# rel=noopener>He reportedly agreed to have his salary reduced by a few million dollars so the producers could afford to hire Al Pacino</a>.</p><p>The film was the <a href=# class=rank-math-link>beginning of his most successful period</a> financially and “The Matrix” would take his career to new heights. He was paid $10 million upfront for the first film in the trilogy but this eventually rose to $35 million from profit-sharing when it turned out to be a smash hit.</p><p>The huge success of “The Matrix” meant that Warner Bros soon greenlit a pair of sequels, to be made simultaneously and released half a year apart in 2003. It’s unclear exactly how much Reeves was paid for the sequels, though it’s believed he was being paid about $15 million per movie at the time.</p><p>In any case, the “Matrix” sequels were even greater successes, with <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Matrix Reloaded” in particular becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie for 13 years until it was eventually overtaken by “Deadpool”</a>. As Keanu retained a sizable profit-sharing deal in his contract, <a href=# rel=noopener>it’s believed that he was paid as much as $250 million for starring in the two sequels</a>.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, however, Reeves decided to donate much of his profit-sharing money to the films’ production. <a href=# rel=noopener>It’s alleged that he gave away tens of millions to the special-effects and costume-design teams</a>, saying that they deserved to be properly funded for their hard work on making the movies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Wick</h2><p>Reeves’ next big series would debut a decade later with the premiere of “John Wick” in 2014. The film, which had a modest $20 million budget, saw <a href=# class=rank-math-link>Reeves reportedly</a> paid less than $2 million.</p><p>His reduction in salary was not unique to him; the majority of major film projects no longer pay their stars significant salaries upfront and prefer to backload their contracts with box office incentives. <a href=# rel=noopener>“John Wick” made $80 million globally, meaning Reeves likely made a good deal more than his initial payment</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>While he received a higher salary for the sequels, about $2.5 million for “John Wick: Chapter 2”</a>, the film’s much larger $171 million worldwide gross means he probably made significantly more than he did for the original movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdqrCpecOonKxlm5qur8GMq5yerpWoeq6typ5kqZ2iYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
