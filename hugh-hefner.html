He had two children with his former wife Mildred “Millie” Williams; and two children, including teacher, activist, and Democratic politician <a href=#>Cooper Hefner</a>, with his former wife, model and actress Kimberley Conrad. Cooper succeeded Hugh as the public face of Playboy, and is its chief creative officer and chief of global partnerships.</p><p>One genealogy of Hugh traces his patrilineal line to a Nicholas Hevener, who was born, c. 1707, in Hirshfeld, Saxony, Germany, and to his wife, Anna Elisabeth Seibert, born c. 1719, in Eitzweiler, Saarland Bezirk, Germany.</p><p>Hugh’s paternal grandfather was James Marston Hefner (the son of Marion Hefner and Sarah Jane Butler).

Lurena was the daughter of Masury Joy Woodward and Mary Wright, who were from Rutland, Rutland Co., Vermont, and were of Colonial American (English) descent.</p><p>Hugh’s maternal grandfather was Frank David Swanson (the son of Anders Johan “Andrew John” Svensson/Swanson and Caroline C. Hill). Frank was born in Illinois, to Swedish parents.
