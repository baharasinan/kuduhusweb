The rest of the money – a paltry $25,000 in comparison – went to the actual athletic program.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The year before, it was even worse: Pitino again netted $1.5 million, while just $10,000 went to the athletic department.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Under both the existing contract and the new one, money that goes from Adidas to Louisville coaches under these personal service agreements is taken from the overall funds provided to the athletic program. Adidas also gives apparel, shoes, and scholarships for an internship program.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenny Klein, the spokesman for Louisville's athletic department, argued the money going to Pitino was actually beneficial to student-athletes. Klein said that players come to Louisville in part because of Pitino, and added the coach already had a contract with Adidas before the program signed a deal with the company.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Of course, that was all said before the bribery scandal of last month. Might there be even more money that's been exchanged?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The new contract calls for about $79 million in cash to go to the Louisville program, in addition to shoes and other apparel. Details of the deal aren't public, so it's not yet known how much would go to coaches.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That cash </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>isn't </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>going to players, though. The NCAA's stance has consistently been that it can't – or won't – pay its players. To see so much money going into a coach's pocket isn't a good look.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqugnKNdpba1tc2oZKudk5q2t7HDZnBxZaCav6Sxza1knJmjnXqtu9Siqq%2BhnKGytHnAnaCdmaNisaaty2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
