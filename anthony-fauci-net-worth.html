Anthony Fauci is best known for serving as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as well as the Chief Medical Advisor to the President of the United States. For over 50 years, he has worked in the public health sector, and has made significant contributions to scientific research on a variety of viral diseases. In 2020, Fauci gained renewed recognition as one of the leading members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Anthony Fauci was born on Christmas Eve in 1940 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His father, Stephen, was a pharmacist and pharmacy owner, while his mother, Eugenia, worked at the pharmacy's register with his sister. Fauci is of Italian descent. As a teen, he attended Regis High School, a private Jesuit school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. There, he captained the school basketball team. Fauci subsequently attended the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts, graduating in 1962 with a BA in classics with a pre-med track. He went on to enroll at Cornell University's medical college, from which he graduated with his MD in 1966. Fauci then took an internship and residency at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.</p><h2 id=national-institute-allergy-infectious-disease><strong>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease</strong></h2><p>Following the completion of his medical residency in 1968, Fauci became a clinical associate at the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. In 1974, he became head of the physiology section, and in 1980 became chief of the NIAID's Laboratory of Immunoregulation. Four years later, he was appointed the director of the NIAID, a position he has held ever since.</p><p>Fauci has been at the forefront of efforts in the United States to combat such viral diseases as SARS, Ebola, the Swine flu, and COVID-19. Additionally, he has made numerous critical scientific observations that have advanced the study and understanding of human immunology. Fauci has developed therapies for various diseases that were once fatal, and has contributed substantially to the understanding of HIV/AIDS. In the early 80s, he was one of the leading researchers tackling the AIDS epidemic when the rest of the government was ignoring it.</p><h2 id=covid-19><strong>COVID-19</strong></h2><p>Since 2020, Fauci has been leading the charge in educating the public about the COVID-19 pandemic. He was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force under <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>, and became the de facto public health spokesperson for the office of the president. Fauci was an early advocate of mitigation measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing to slow the spread of the virus. His efforts were frequently hampered, however, by the Trump administration, which refused to take the threat of COVID-19 seriously, and vocally opposed safety protocols while propagating false and conspiratorial information about the disease.</p><p>Fauci has had a smoother time in his role at the NIAID and the White House under <a href=#>President Joe Biden</a>. He has described the experience as "liberating," as he no longer has to worry about speaking openly and truthfully about science. Moreover, the public availability of vaccines in early 2021 to target COVID-19 led to a decrease in cases and a reopening of much of the country.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-327386 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anthony-Fauci.jpg alt="Anthony Fauci Net Worth" width=900 height=606 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-327386 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)</p><h2 id=cultural-impact><strong>Cultural Impact</strong></h2><p>Although he has worked in the American public health sector for over five decades, Fauci has experienced his most widespread recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic.
