Named a captain in his sophomore year, he averaged 8.4 points and 4.5 rebounds per game. The Seminoles went on to make it to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament, but Mann saw limited playing time due to torn abdominal and groin muscles.</p><p>Back to health in his junior year, Mann averaged 12.6 points and 5.4 rebounds per game.

After starting out with the Clippers in the NBA Summer League, he officially signed with the team in July. Mann made his NBA debut in late October, coming off the bench in a 141-122 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Later, after the season came back from COVID-related suspension in the summer of 2020, Mann posted a then-career high of 25 points, 14 rebounds, and nine assists in a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Clippers went on to reach the Western Conference Semifinals, where they fell to the Denver Nuggets in seven games.
