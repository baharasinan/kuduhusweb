Earle, who wrapped her arms and legs around the NFL star, <a href=#>wore a black bikini</a> and tied her long blonde locks in a low ponytail.</p><p class=p1>“Big fan of this,” Berrios commented on Earle’s snap, before reposting it onto his Instagram Story.</p><p class=p1>Earle had started uploading photos with Berrios via her social media in June, fresh off her split from baseball player <strong>Tyler Wade</strong>. Earle <a href=#>never shared Berrios’ face in the snaps</a> and only referred to the Miami Dolphins wide receiver as “Sexy NFL Man.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TikTok-Star-Alix-Earle-Makes-Out-With-NFL-Pro-Braxton-Berrios-in-Steamy-PDA-Photo.jpg><p class=p1>One month later, Earle and Berrios<a href=#> made their red carpet debut</a> at the 2023 ESPYs but neither shared the photos via social media. While <a href=#>they weren’t exclusively dating</a> at the time, they continued to see one another.</p><p class=p1>Earle even attended one of Berrios’ Dolphins games last month. “Fins up <span class=s1>🐬</span>, dogs down <span class=s1>🌭</span>,” she captioned a September <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> carousel from a tailgate party, in which she wore a jersey with Berrios’ name and number on the back.</p><p class=p1>Days earlier, Earle <a href=#>recounted the beginning of their relationship</a> during an episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.</p><p class=p1>“We started <a href=#>talking at a very weird time</a> in my life, I was finishing college,” she told host <a href=#><strong>Alex Cooper</strong></a>. “As much as we were hanging out, it never felt like the right time to start a relationship.”</p><p class=p1>Earle also denied reports that she had come in between Berrios and his now-ex <a href=#><strong>Sophia Culpo</strong></a>, who previously <a href=#>accused the pair of cheating</a>.</p><p class=p1>“When I was reading these comments, I was bawling my eyes out to my friends and they were like, ‘Hello, Alix, this stuff normally does not get to you,’” Earle confessed on the September 20 podcast. “I spent my childhood basically thinking that this is the worst thing you could do to another human, so why the f—k would I do that?”</p><p class=p1>Berrios and Culpo, 26, <a href=#>started dating in 2021</a> before the <i>Culpo Sisters </i>star revealed in March that s<a href=#>he was newly single after allegedly being cheated</a> on by her former partner.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Berrios quickly denied her claims, asserting that they split in January before he moved on with Earle.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t want to start anything, I don’t want to fuel anything. I genuinely want all this to be over and everyone to move on and do whatever makes them happy,” <a href=#>he said in an Instagram Story</a> video in June. “I was in a relationship for two years. It was a good relationship, it was a healthy one and towards the end of it we had conversations along the lines of ‘we weren’t working out.’ So, when we split back in January, that’s why.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZupvKx50q2Yq2WRoba5ecSaqaWdXZa7pXnBq5ixrJ%2BjeqOx0augqKtdoLa0v4yipWarpJqursWMm5yam5hivam706hm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
