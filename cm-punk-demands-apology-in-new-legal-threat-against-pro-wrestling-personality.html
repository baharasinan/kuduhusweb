That doesn’t mean he is willing to let anyone say whatever they want about him. Now, the Second City Savior’s legal team has sent out a legal threat, and there is a lot to unpack.</p><p><a href=#>We previously reported that </a>CM Punk’s attorneys sent pro wrestling personality Billi Bhatti a threatening legal letter over comments he made, and a t-shirt that he put out. CM Punk isn’t playing around, and he has demands.</p><p>During the latest episode of the<a href=#> Dirty Sheets</a>, Billi Bhatti explained why CM Punk is suing him. This is all over a tweet with a meme and a t-shirt. Of course, that meme and t-shirt alludes to the idea that CM Punk is a pedophile.</p><p>Billi Bhatti continued to detail what CM Punk wants. He demands and apology, and he wants everything taken down as well. A retraction isn’t on Billi’s agenda, though.</p><p>“They want to pretend in this piece of paperwork that I deliberately made these comments to hurt CM Punk. Now, if I deliberately said these comments, that means that I deliberately wanted to damage the reputation of CM Punk. As we move forward with this, they asked for an apology at the end of the letter, where they want me to retract the comments and even admit that I deliberately tried to insult and defame CM Punk. “</p><p>“This is not the case because, as we just established, I feel this way. Everything I said is genuinely what I think. It is my opinion. Even to the point where you make the comment where I say, ‘he’s not man enough to be a dad.’ These are my beliefs. I genuinely believe that if you have the money, and you have the capability to have a child, you should have a child. That’s what we are hear to do. We are hear to recreate.”</p><p>Billi Bhatti also noted that, “As we move forward with this, they asked for an apology at the end of the letter where they want me to retract the comments and even admit that I deliberately tried to insult and defame CM Punk. “</p><p>We will have to see if this situation goes away. As of this writing, CM Punk has not commented on Billi Bhatti’s letter, but it seems that Billi has no issue letting everyone know what he received in the mail.</p><p>What’s your take on this new CM Punk legal issue?
