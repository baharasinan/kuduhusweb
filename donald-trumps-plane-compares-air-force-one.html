First off, Trump would have to get used to living in the White House, which might actually not be quite as nice as his New York City Penthouses and suburban mansions. Secondly, Trump may also find that the President's mode of air transportation, Air Force One, is actually a step down from his own personal "Trump Force One" private plane. Don't believe me? Ask The Donald himselfâ€¦</p><p>Trump recently said that compared to his private plane, Air Force One is "a step down from this in every way." He&nbsp;claimed that his private plane's engines are stronger and the the body of the aircraft is larger than Air Force One. That last claim is simply is not true. In reality, Trump's plane is much smaller than Air Force One, 747, and it cannot fly nearly as fast or as far. But that's not to say Donald's plane isn't awesome.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165845 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages-481701034.jpg alt="Matthew Busch/Getty Images" width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-165845 class=wp-caption-text>Matthew Busch/Getty Images</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166348 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/plane.jpg alt="Matthew Busch/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-166348 class=wp-caption-text>Matthew Busch/Getty Images</p><p>Mr. Trump paid about <strong>$100 million</strong> for his plane, which he purchased from the Microsoft billionaire <a href=#>Paul Allen</a>. Trump has customized the plane, adding 24-karat gold seat-belt buckles and outlet plates, along with the gold trim on the bathtub in his master bedroom. His plane also features polished woods and silks.</p><p>Trump Force One has a movie theater that features a big screen and a choice of over 1,000 movies that can be played on&nbsp;a state of the art sound system. The plane, which was built in 1991, has a dining room, big screen TVs, and a guest bedroom. In addition to his commercial-sized Boeing 757-2000, with his last name in gold letters and a big red "T" on the back, the Donald also owns <strong>two</strong> Sikorsky S-76B helicopters and a Cessna Citation X private corporate jet that seats 12.</p><p>If you think Trump is overdoing it, he has actually trimmed down his collection; he once owned a fleet of <strong>17 planes</strong>.</p><p>While <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> certainly has a nice private plane, flying in Air Force One is also a luxurious experience. There are actually two Air Force One planes that can seat 76 passengers a piece. The planes feature a conference room, various weapons, and a small hospital. Air Force One can go up to 600 miles per hour and has the ability to refuel in midair.</p><p>If Trump is actually serious about becoming President, he is going to have to get used to Air Force One. I sure hope he can make-do!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJom6imkaGxbsDRrqSpq12luaK6xGaaqKWglr%2Bmv4yaoKtllqS%2FpLGMqKWeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
