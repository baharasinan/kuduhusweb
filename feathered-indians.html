The opening lines, "Well my buckle makes impressions / On the inside of her thigh / There are little feathered Indians / Where we tussled through the night," use vivid imagery to describe a physical encounter with his lover. The reference to "feathered Indians" suggests a sense of wildness and adventure, which feeds into the singer's feelings of excitement and passion. However, as the song progresses, the singer reveals that he is conflicted about the relationship, as he discovers that his lover is religious, and he regrets coming to her house while under the influence of drugs. This creates a sense of tension and unease that contrasts with the earlier lyrics.</p><br><p>When the singer says, "Lookin' over West Virginia / Smoking Spirits on the roof / She asked ain't anybody told ya / That them things are bad for you," he shows that his partner is concerned for his wellbeing and is trying to take care of him. Yet, the singer also reveals that he struggles with addiction and is unable to let go of certain behaviors, as he remarks, "But up till now, there ain't been nothing / That I couldn't leave behind." This creates a sense of vulnerability and instability in the relationship. The final lines of the song, "I'd go runnin' through the thicket / I'd go careless through the thorns / Just to hold her for a minute / Though it'd leave me wanting more," express the singer's intense desire for his partner, even if it means experiencing pain and hardship to be with her.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Well my buckle makes impressions On the inside of her thigh</u><br>The singer and his partner had an intimate moment that left marks on her body from his belt buckle.</p><br><p><u>There are little feathered Indians Where we tussled through the night</u><br>Feathered Indians is a metaphor for the marks left on her body after their passionate night together.</p><br><p><u>If I'd known she was religious Then I wouldn't have came stoned To the house of such an angel Too fucked up to get back home</u><br>The singer made a mistake by showing up high to his partner's house, especially since he later found out that she was religious.</p><br><p><u>Lookin' over West Virginia Smoking Spirits on the roof She asked ain't anybody told ya That them things are bad for you I said many folks have warned me There's been several people try But up till now, there ain't been nothing That I couldn't leave behind</u><br>The artist is smoking and his partner chastises him for it, but he is not willing to give it up for her just yet.</p><br><p><u>Hold me close my dear Sing your whispering song Softly in my ear And I will sing along Honey, tell me how your love runs true And how I can always count on you To be there when the bullets fly I'd run across a river just to hold you tonight</u><br>The artist is deeply in love with his partner and wants nothing more than to be with her, even during tough times.</p><br><p><u>Well my heart is sweating bullets From the circles it has raced Like a little feathered indian Callin' out the clouds for rain I'd go runnin' through the thicket I'd go careless through the thorns Just to hold her for a minute Though it'd leave me wanting more</u><br>The singer's heart is pounding from the intensity of his feelings for his partner and he would go to any length to be with her.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Tyler Timothy Childers</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIypobKzq6KhoKWclafAcJLEmquhnaKasaCVzZ2gmqaj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
