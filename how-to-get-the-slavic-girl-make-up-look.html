Inspired by the infectious (and viral) Russian beat of Katya Lel’s ‘My Marmalade’ and the cosy winter vibes of fur hats and stylish coats, this make-up trend is all about embracing your inner Slavic goddess with flushed cheeks, pouty pink lips, and a touch of Eastern European charm. Join the craze as we break down the steps to achieve the perfect ‘Slavic Girl’ make-up look that has everyone singing along.</p><h2 data-score=59>Step 1: The Canvas – Prep Your Skin for Radiance</h2><p data-score=54>Before diving into the make-up magic, start with a clean canvas. Hydrate your skin with a moisturiser to achieve that coveted dewy glow. Follow it up with a primer to create a smooth base for your make-up to adhere to, ensuring a flawless finish that lasts all day.</p><h2 data-score=59>Step 2: The Concealer – Accentuate Your Features</h2><p data-score=72>Apply a brightening concealer to the high points of your face—under the eyes, along the bridge of your nose, on your forehead, and above your cupid’s bow. This technique not only conceals but also accentuates, setting the stage for a sculpted and snatched appearance. Follow with a light skin tint or foundation for a seamless and natural-looking base.</p><h2 data-score=75>Step 3: Contouring – Sculpt Your Features with Subtle Definition</h2><p data-score=55>Elevate your look by adding a touch of contouring. Use a contour stick or powder to define your cheekbones, jawline, and nose. Keep it subtle for a naturally sculpted appearance, ensuring that your features stand out without overshadowing the overall radiance of the look.</p><h2 data-score=73>Step 4: Rosy Cheeks – Blush Like You’ve Never Blushed Before</h2><p data-score=69>The ‘Slavic Girl’ look is all about those enviable rosy cheeks. Opt for a soft, pink blush to add a natural flush to your complexion. Apply it to the apples of your cheeks, blending it slightly towards your temples for a youthful and radiant effect. Remember, the key is to look like you’ve just stepped in from the chilly winter air.</p><h2 data-score=70>Step 5: Pouty Pink Lips – Channel Your Inner Marmalade Muse</h2><p data-score=71>For lips that are as sweet as the viral sensation itself, go for a pouty pink shade. Whether it’s a glossy finish or a cherry lip tint, the goal is to evoke the playful spirit of the ‘Slavic Girl.’ Outline your lips with a lip liner for definition, then fill in with your chosen shade, adding a touch of lip gloss for that extra dose of allure.</p><h2 data-score=64>Step 6: Eyes – Sparkle and Shine with Subtle Elegance</h2><p data-score=85>Keep your eye make-up simple yet captivating. Start with a neutral eyeshadow base, opting for shades like soft beige or warm taupe. Add a touch of white eyeshadow or eyeliner to the inner corners of your eyes to create a bright and open look. For a hint of mystery, go for a subtle smokey eyeliner, framing your eyes with a touch of drama. Finish with a coat of mascara for long, fluttery lashes that command attention.</p><h2 data-score=66>Step 7: Highlight – Beam Like the Snow-Kissed Landscape</h2><p data-score=64>To complete the ‘Slavic Girl’ make-up look, highlight the high points of your face. Choose a luminous highlighter and apply it to the tops of your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and your cupid’s bow. This step adds that ethereal glow, making you look like you’ve just returned from a winter wonderland.</p><p data-score=55>And there you have it – the key to unlocking the viral ‘Slavic Girl’ aesthetic that has taken social media by storm. Whether you’re singing along to ‘My Marmalade’ or simply enjoying the winter vibes, this make-up is bound to make you the star of the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnmO1prjLqKSan5Gvtq%2BxjZympmeSmq62wNhoaWlqY2Z%2FcX6SaWpwb2JktbDDjK2mZp%2BVqXq1tMRmqqWZpp6wbrPIq6NmpZGgsm7Bz2ajqKebZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
