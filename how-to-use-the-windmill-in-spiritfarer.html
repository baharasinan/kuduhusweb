One such mechanic is the Windmill, which is one of the buildings you can build on your boat and will help you grind grains down into flours. Just purchase the Craftsman upgrade from Albert to be able to build it. Now, let’s take a look at how to use the Windmill in Spiritfarer.</p><p data-injection=true>First, go up to the Windmill’s mid-level and interact with the compartment there. You can do this by pressing Square on PlayStation 4, X on Xbox One, and Y on Nintendo Switch. Place the grains into the compartment, and then it’s on to the next step.</p><p>Move up to the top of the Windmill and interact with the column there. This will allow you to change the Windmill level, which is seen as a square, you can move up or down with the D-Pad. You will see a smaller wheel on the right, which is what you want to get spinning.</p><p data-injection=true>Adjust the Windmill level until the wheel starts to spin. As long as that wheel is spinning, that is how you know the mill is grinding down the grains. Just pay attention to that wheel and keep it spinning.</p><p>Once you have ground down all the grain, you will automatically be taken off the column, and you’ll know you’re all done!</p><p data-injection=true>It’s pretty simple once you know what you’re doing with it and get the process down. It’s very similar to cutting wood or smelting metals, just with a little more player interaction.</p><p>With this knowledge, you can cook all kinds of delicious foods for the wayward Spirits you meet.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3aca09fd9162bad755386baf6792eb70?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Shane Black</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Shane Black</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLWww4ytpmato5p6tbTEZq6ippSitq24jKKlZqugnr%2BqwMWaqZ6q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
