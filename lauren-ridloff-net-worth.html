Her father, Hugo, is a Mexican-American musician who also worked as a counselor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Her mother is African-American and worked as an artist. Ridloff was born deaf to two hearing parents, though her parents initially thought she had a developmental delay. They learned she was deaf at the age of two. They then learned sign language and enrolled her in a school with hearing children, where she performed well. At the age of 13, she decided to stop using her voice so people would not judge her intelligence on the basis of her vocal skills.For high school, Ridloff attended the Model Secondar School for the Deaf in Washington, DC. There, she began exploring the arts, including ceramics and drama. She played the character of Dorothy in a production "The Wiz." She also was on the cheerleading team and became one of the first deaf American cheerleaders to compete internationally.</p><p>Following high school, Ridloff attended California State University, Northridge. The university attracted a large number of dead and hard-of-hearing students because it was home to the National Center on Deafness. She majored in English and also studied creative writing. During this time, she also joined a local deaf performing group and began hip-hop dancing.</p><p>She graduated from college in 2000 and began working in a program for secondary students who were also deaf. She decided to compete in the Miss Deaf America competition hosted by the National Association of the Deaf. She first won Miss Deaf Illinois before moving on to the national competition, which she also won. One of her performances in the competition included an ASL performance of the book "The Giving Tree" by <a href=# title="Shel Silverstein Net Worth">Shel Silverstein</a>. She then toured for the next couple of years as a spokesperson for the National Association of the Deaf (NAD).</p><p>After this period, she then enrolled at Hunter College in New York in order to study education. She hoped to become an author of children's books. Ridloff earned her Master's Degree in Education in 2005 and began working as a kindergarten and first grade teacher in Manhattan.

Ridloff had a hard time using her voice as it had been so many years since she had used it regularly. After working with a vocal coach, she felt more at ease. The play initially ran at the Berkshire Theatre Group in Massachusetts before premiering on Broadway in April of 2018. Though the play itself did not charm critics, Ridloff's individual performance did.
