Again, any instance of me defending the Yankee GM during tonight’s broadcast, and I will gladly make the donation.</p><p>“And if you can’t come up with proof, and you will not be able to because it doesn’t exist, I want nothing back from you, other than you gaining the knowledge that what you and others hear is that when someone isn’t bashing Cashman who think they’re defending him. I will patiently await the proof. Thank you for watching the game on Prime.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/GettyImages-1090426564-3.jpg><p>The Yankees are off to a 17-15 start, which for many fan bases would be perfectly acceptable, but the Bombers have a $300 million payroll and are in the stacked AL East where this above .500 record still has them in last place.</p><p><a href=#>Cashman said Wednesday</a> to not “count us out,” but that message has hardly calmed the nerves of Yankees fans.</p><p>Kay, meanwhile, grew impatient after not receiving a response from the fan with evidence that the broadcaster has defended the Yankees GM.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/GettyImages-1475611840.jpg><p>“And still no answer,” Kay, <a href=#>also a host at ESPN New York</a>, tweeted. “That’s all you have. I never DM anyone anything I wouldn’t make public so this is fine but the fact I gave you the consideration of DMing you a response and you made it public tells me all I need to know about you and your opinion. LOL.”</p><p>Thursday morning, after still not getting an answer, Kay <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he would be making a donation of his own to The Alzheimer’s Association.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25maWxforaktMCeo2ajka56pL7UrJ%2Beq12brq95wJ%2BrnqpdqcSqwNOeqWacnah6oq7OrqtmmqKerq95wpqqoaWRo3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
