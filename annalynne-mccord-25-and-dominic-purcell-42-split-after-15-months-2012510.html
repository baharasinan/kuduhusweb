The stars met while shooting Officer Down in early 2011; the film has yet to be released.</p><p>One insider believes McCord decided to end the relationship after her two sisters, <strong>Angel</strong> and <strong>Rachel</strong>, both got engaged. "Though AnnaLynne's not in a rush to get married, her sisters getting engaged must have made her evaluate her own relationship to some degree," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Adding that Purcell seemed "more into AnnaLynne than she was into him," the insider says the starlet "recognized the imbalance in their romantic dynamic."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A second source tells <strong>Us McCord</strong> "fell for Dom hard" in the beginning. Despite their 17-year age difference, "they made it work."</p><p>Prior to his relationship with McCord, Prison Break star Purcell was married to <strong>Rebecca Williamson</strong>; they split in 2007. The former spouses are parents to son <strong>Joseph</strong>, 13, daughter <strong>Audrey</strong>, 11, and twins <strong>Lily-Rose</strong> and <strong>Augustus</strong>, 9. McCord dated hunky Twilight star <strong>Kellan Lutz</strong>, 27, on-and-off from 2008 to 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJinppGhxq%2B6xGaknJufp7FufpRmmKecXZm8rrXNoppmqKWnsKa4y2Zra2WjpbmqwIyana2domJ%2BdnnMqKWtoKNif3F9kW5oaQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeJolt - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
